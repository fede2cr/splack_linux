>Linux has so much in common with commercial unices, that almost
everything you read there will apply to Linux. The FAQ's, like all
FAQ's, be found on

(the 
<A
HREF="mailto:mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu</TT
></A
> can send
you these files, if you don't have FTP access). There are mirrors of
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rtfm</TT
>'s FAQ archives on various sites.  Check the
Introduction to *.answers posting, or look in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>news-answers/introduction</TT
> in the directory above.</P
><P
>Check the relevant HOWTO for the subject in question, if there is one,
or an appropriate old style sub-FAQ document. Check the FTP sites.</P
><P
>Try experimenting&#8212;that's the best way to get to know Unix and Linux.</P
><P
>Read the documentation. Check the manual pages (type 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man man</TT
> if
you don't know about manual pages. Also try 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man -k subject</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>apropos subject</TT
>.  They 
often list useful and relevant, but not very obvious, manual pages.</P
><P
>Check the Info documentation (type 
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>i</B
>, 
i.e. the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
> function key followed by ``i''
in Emacs). This isn't just for Emacs. For example, the GCC
documentation lives here as well.</P
><P
>There will also often be a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README</TT
> 
file with a package that gives
installation and/or usage instructions.</P
><P
>Make sure you don't have a corrupted or out-of-date copy of the
program in question. If possible, download it again and re-install
it&#8212;you probably made a mistake the first time.</P
><P
>Read <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.os.linux.announce</I
>.  It often 
contains very important information for all Linux users.

General X Window System questions belong in 
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.windows.x.i386unix</I
>,
not in <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.os.linux.x</I
>. 
But read the group first (including the FAQ),
before you post.

Only if you have done all of these things and are still stuck, should
you post to the appropriate <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.os.linux.*</I
> 
newsgroup. Make sure you
read the next question first. "( What to put in a request for
help. )"</P

posting or E-mail. Making a complete posting will greatly increase the
chances that an expert or fellow user reading it will have enough
information and motivation to reply.</P
><P
>This advice applies both to postings asking for advice and to personal
E-mail sent to experts and fellow users.</P
><P
>Make sure you give full details of the problem, including:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>What program, exactly, you are having problems with. Include the
version number if known and say where you got it. Many standard
commands tell you their version number if you give them a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--version</TT
> option.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Which Linux release you're using (Red Hat, Slackware, Debian, or
whatever) and what version of that release.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The exact and complete text of any error messages printed.</P
></LI

observed. A transcript of an example session is a good way to show
this.</P

question and any related programs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>What version of the kernel and shared libraries you have
installed. The kernel version can be found by typing

appropriate.</P

><P
>You are in little danger of making your posting too long unless you
include large chunks of source code or uuencoded files, so err on the
side of giving too much information.</P
><P
>Use a clear, detailed Subject line. Don't put things like ``doesn't
work,'' ``Linux,'' ``help,'' or ``question'' in it&#8212;we already know that.
Save the space for the name of the program, a fragment of an error
message, or summary of the unusual behavior.</P
><P
>Put a summary paragraph at the top of your posting.</P
><P
>At the bottom of your posting, ask for responses by email and say
you'll post a summary. Back this up by using 
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Followup-To: poster</TT
>.''
Then, actually post the summary in a few days or a week or so. Don't
just concatenate the replies you got&#8212;summarize. Putting the word
``SUMMARY'' in your summary's Subject line is also a good idea. Consider
submitting the summary to <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.os.linux.announce</I
>.</P
><P
>Make sure your posting doesn't have an inappropriate References:
header line. This marks your article as part of the thread of the
article referred to, which will often cause it to be junked by
readers, along with the rest of a boring thread.</P
><P
>You might like to say in your posting that you've read this FAQ and
the appropriate HOWTO's&#8212;this may make people less likely to skip your
posting.</P

the sender's permission.</P
