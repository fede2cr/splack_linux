<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What are good makers of Travan tapes?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I was the UNIX Product Manager at Archive Corp (Prior to the Conner/Seagate   
mess) and we performed extensive tests of tape media for compatibility   
certification, including retentivity, flaking and length consistancy.  Based   
on the results of the tests, we selected the best of these certified   
manufacturers' products to private label as our own media.  Here is the   
order in which we selected vendors up through 1995 (when I lost contact   
with the ATI group):
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>QIC</B><DD><P>
<OL>
<LI> 3M (now known as Imation)</LI>
<LI> QMaxell/Sony (tie)</LI>
<LI> (BTW - Iomega uses Sony private-labelled media)</LI>
</OL>
<DT><B>4MM</B><DD><P>
<OL>
<LI> Fuji</LI>
<LI> Maxell/Sony (tie - is this a trend?)</LI>
</OL>
<DT><B>8MM</B><DD><P>
<OL>
<LI> Fuji/Exabyte - which we believed to be OEM'd Fuji (tie - so much for trend!)</LI>
<LI> Sony</LI>
<LI> Maxell</LI>
</OL>
<DT><B>DLT</B><DD><P>
<OL>
<LI> Maxell</LI>
<LI> Sony</LI>
</OL>
</DL>
<P>Otherwise, we had entries in our search from other vendors which were   
generally a private-labelled version of one of the major labels above. The   
exceptions were Verbatim and DIC.  Both of these manufacturer's media had   
fall-out rates and length discrepancies that were so high that we would not   
certify them and even warned customers about them indicating that we could   
not offer any sort of guarantee that they would get a good backup using the   
media from these manufacturers.
<P>In addition, since coming to EST, I've found that Verbatim media is still   
not worth the money saved in purchasing it.  We have 11 of their TR-Extra   
and QIC-Extra (QICXL) tapes that were useless after fewer than 20 passes each.
<P>While this is my personal opinion, it is based on over 9 years of experience   
with this very question, I strongly recommend Imation/3M media for QIC/Travan   
user, Fuji media 4MM users, Exabyte/Fuji for 8MM and DEC labelled media   
for DLT users.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Where can I obtain the QIC standards?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you wish to help developing <EM>Ftape</EM>, or add some utility  
(e.g. a tape formatting program), you will need that appropriate QIC  
standards.  The standard(s) to get is: QIC-80, -117, -3010, and 3020.  
QIC-117 describes how commands are sent to the tape drive (including  
timing etc), so you would probably never need it.  QIC-80/3010/3020  
describes higher level part, such as tape layout, ECC code, standard  
filesystem.  You can get the QIC standards from the following address:

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Is the Iomega Ditto 2GB drive supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Yes, if you are using version <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> or later of the <EM>Ftape
drivers</EM> from the 
<A HREF="http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/">Ftape Home Page</A> or from
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes</A>.
<P>&lt;answer from Tim Jones&gt;
<P>As the Ditto 2GB is a Tr-3 tape (though it can only store 1GB instead of the  
1.6GB you get with a regular Tr-3 drive) you need an FDC (FDC means: Floppy  
Disk Controller) that is capable of at 1Mbit/sec transfer rate. You don't need  
to worry about this if you have an accellerator card (i.e. the Ditto Dash  
controller). Otherwise try to purchase an FDC that claims to be capable of  
driving 2.88Mb floppies because this implies that the FDC is capable of 1Mbit  
transfer rate.
<P><EM>Ftape</EM> prints the maximum data rate of the FDC to the kernel log
files like this:
<PRE>
ftape-ctl.c (ftape_init_drive) - Highest FDC supported data rate: 500 Kbps.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Is the Iomega Ditto Max drive supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Yes, if you are using version <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> or later of the
<EM>Ftape drivers</EM> from the 
<A HREF="http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/">Ftape Home Page</A> or from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes</A>.
<P>&lt;answer from Claus Heine&gt;
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Is the Iomega Ditto Max Pro drive supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Yes. But if you want to use the 5GB (10GB with compression) cartridges
you don't need it. With <CODE>ftape</CODE> there doesn't seem to be any
difference between the <CODE>Ditto Max</CODE> and the <CODE>Ditto Max Pro</CODE>.
