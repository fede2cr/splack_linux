  3.  Introduction


  3.1.  How to slay and reincarnate your linux box!

  The purpose of this document is to offer tips to help you through the
  destruction and reinstallation of a linux system.  It's not a
  foolproof cookbook by any means; but I hope it will serve as some
  indication of what you need to think about, and of the order in which
  to do things.  It would have been a help to me, if someone else had
  written something like this before I did my first upgrade; so I hope
  it will be a help to you, if you have a linux machine to rebuild.

  Don't take it as gospel, though: your mileage will almost certainly
  vary.  Even the directory names in this document may be different from
  the ones you need to use; some people have /usr/home instead of /home,
  for example; others call it /u, and some (delicate shudder :) even put
  all their users directly under /usr itself!  I can't be specific about
  your system, so I've just used the names the way they are in mine.

  You'll also notice that I use Slackware distributions, and that I
  assume you've enough RAM and hard disk space to install linux kernel
  source and build your own kernel.  If your system is different, some
  of my recommendations won't apply; but I hope you'll still find the
  general outline to be of assistance in your rebuild project.


  3.2.  Why would anyone want to do that?

  Good question!  If it can possibly be avoided, don't do it!  (That's
  the single most important recommendation in this whole guide!!!)  But
  there are times when you may have to.

  For example, I installed a 4Gb hard disk and then found out that
  Slackware 2.0 vintage linux didn't know a hard disk could have more
  than 2Gb, and it got horribly confused.  So I had to upgrade to the
  then-current Slackware 2.3.  That upgrade was a gruelling experience,
  and it's part of the reason I'm writing these notes.  I did just about
  everything wrong, and only good luck and the fact that I had another
  running linux box beside me saved me from disaster.

  As another example, I found that I just couldn't succeed in building a
  working a.out linux kernel in the 1.3 series, using an out-of-the-box
  Slackware 2.3 installation (another machine, not the one I botched
  before).  I took the plunge, bought Slackware 3.0 on CDROM and
  converted to ELF.  This time the reinstallation went better, thanks in
  part to the previous bitter experience, and it served as the source of
  most of the ideas I'm offering you here.


  3.3.  Do you have to ``destroy and reinstall?''

  It's safer, oddly enough.  If you install over top of an existing
  linux system, chances are you'll have a mixture of old and new
  binaries, old and new configuration files, and generally a mess to try
  to administer.  Wiping the system clean, and then putting back only
  what you know you need, is a drastic but effective way to get a clean
  result.  (Of course we're talking about installing a whole new linux
  distribution here, not about upgrading one or two packages!  The best
  way to avoid having to do a full reinstallation is, precisely, to keep
  the individual bits -- especially gcc and its libraries, and binutils
  -- current.  If the stuff you use is reasonably up-to-date, and you
  can keep it so by bringing in, and if need be compiling, new code from
  time to time, then there's no need for a mass upgrade.)

  As Patrick Volkerding points out (he too recommends the wipe-it-clean
  procedure for upgrades), installing ELF on top of a running a.out
  system is a recipe for disaster; at least, if you know enough to try
  it, you needn't read this guide!

  Even without that complication, though, you're better to build from
  scratch.


  3.4.  How long will it take?

  Depends, of course, on how complex your system is.  But I figure that,
  for the successful upgrade (the other one? -- don't ask! :) I spent
  about ten hours making backups, six hours rebuilding the system to the
  point where I could enable logins, and another half day or thereabouts
  restoring the less-crucial stuff.  As time passes I keep discovering
  little things that still aren't exactly as I want them -- I fix these
  as they're encountered -- but in the main, twenty hours' work should
  suffice for a reasonably complex rebuilding job.  Maybe less if you're
  reinstalling from hard disk (I used CDROM) or more if you need to
  install from floppies.  Maybe less if you've got a fast Pentium, more
  if it's a 386.  You get the idea.

  So much for the introduction.  Here's how to set about it, once you've
  decided it must be done.  Arm yourself with fortitude and Jolt or
  whatever, and:


  4.  Write down everything you do.

  It's extremely valuable to have a record of what you've done in the
  process of preparing for, and carrying out, the changeover.
  Especially important is a list of the backups you'll be making in
  preparation for the destruction of your existing system.



  5.  Make a full backup of the existing system.

  Generally speaking, backups tend to be written on media that are
  sequentially accessed.  That being so, you won't want to use this
  complete backup for restoring significant numbers of files; it's got
  too many files on it that you don't want.  It's better to create small
  backups of individual segments that you know you're going to restore
  in their entirety.  I'll list a bunch of examples later.

  Why then should you start with a full backup?  Two basic reasons:
  first, in the event of a catastrophic failure installing the new
  system, you'll have a way to get back to the starting point with
  minimum pain.  Second, no matter how carefully you prepare for the new
  installation, there is a very large chance that one or two important
  files will be overlooked.  In that case the clumsiness of restoring
  those one or two files from the full backup set will be preferable to
  the inconvenience of doing without them.

  To save time and space, if you've still got the distribution medium
  for your old linux version, you might want to back up only those files
  the mtime or ctime of which is more recent than the date of the
  original installation.


  6.  Back up /etc and its subdirectories on one or more floppies.

  This is the other extreme: you won't be restoring these files (for the
  most part, anyway); you'll be comparing them with the new ones that
  get created during installation.  Why?  Because the new ones may have
  data that the old ones didn't, or may express the old data in new
  ways.  Changes in protocols, addition of new tools, or implementation
  of new features in existing tools may all dictate changes in the
  formats of the configuration files and startup scripts that the /etc
  tree contains, and you'll very likely have to edit your old data into
  these files so as to preserve the new formats and take advantage of
  the improvements.


  7.  Make separate backups of each group of files you want to preserve.

  This is the most variable part of the job, and all I can really do to
  help is to describe what I did in my system, in the hope that it will
  serve as a rough guide.  Basically, you want to look at every
  directory that contains any


  ·  files that aren't part of your standard linux installation, or

  ·  files that are actually newer than the ones you'll install when you
     do your new linux installation

  and separate out only those files that you want to carry over.

  (Another possible strategy is to back up all files with mtime or ctime
  more recent than the day of the previous linux installation, as
  mentioned above, and then restore from that.  If you do that, you have
  to take into account that the new linux distribution may contain
  versions of some files that are newer still than the ones you saved.)

  In my case, I ended up making a .tgz file on the backup medium for
  each of


  ·  /usr/lib/rn


  ·  /usr/lib/smail

  ·  /usr/lib/trn (the rest of /usr/lib would be reinstalled)

  ·  /usr/local/src

  ·  /usr/local/bin

  ·  /usr/local/lib

  ·  /usr/local/lpfont

  ·  /usr/local/man

  ·  /usr/local/sbin

  ·  /usr/local/thot (there were other /usr/local files I didn't need)

  ·  /usr/openwin

  ·  /usr/src/lilo-17 (because my new Slackware still had version 16)

  ·  /usr/src/linux-1.2.13 (because I'd done some customizing)

  ·  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults

  ·  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/initrc (the rest of Xfree86 was to be
     reinstalled)

  ·  /var/named

  ·  /var/openwin

  ·  /var/texfonts

  My machine was relatively easy in that there were no spool files to
  worry about.  I don't run a news spool on this box, and since there
  are only two users, it was easiest just to get all the mail read
  before shutting down.  Otherwise, /var/spool directories would have
  had to be backed up at the last minute.  (And, of course, the news
  library and site directories!)


  8.  Prepare root and boot floppies for the new installation.

  Details of how to do this will be found in the installation guide for
  your new distribution.


  9.  Format floppies for the temporary kernel and the final build.

  You'll need two, one floppy for each.

  After all that's done, you're ready for the Big Moment.  The next step
  removes the system from production.


  10.  Inhibit logins and back up the /root and /home trees.

  This is the last thing to be done on the old system before you destroy
  it, so as to carry forward the most current user and root information.



  11.  Boot from the new installation's boot and root floppies.


  12.  Delete the linux partitions with fdisk and recreate them.

  The installation guide will explain how to set about doing this, which
  will destroy the old system.  From now on you're dependent on the
  quality of the backups you made in the earlier steps!  You have been
  warned!


  13.  Run the new linux installation.

  There are already several good documents describing how to do this, so
  I'm not going into any detail.  Continue from here when the new system
  can boot from its hard disk.

  Along the way, be sure to make a floppy that you can boot as well,
  since the kernel that the linux setup installs has to be replaced and
  accidents can happen during that process.  Be sure to install the
  development packages and the kernel source.


  14.  With the new linux system booted from the hard disk, edit
  /etc/fstab

  and add your swap partition.  Then run the command "swapon -a".  I
  don't know why, but Slackware setup doesn't offer to do this for you
  if your swap partition exists already.  Then, when you boot your new
  system and the rc.S script tries to turn swapping on, it can't find
  the partition in the fstab file and swapping doesn't get enabled.
  This step fixes it.


  15.  Restore configuration data to the /etc directory and subdirecto­
  ries.

  As described above, you can't just copy all of the old files back into
  /etc and expect things to work properly afterward.  Some files you can
  do that with; for example, /etc/XF86Config (as long as you're using
  the same version of Xfree86 -- and the same video hardware -- in the
  new installation as you did in the old).  For the most part, though,
  it's best to use diff to compare the old and new files before doing
  any copying.  Watch out especially for significant changes in the
  files in /etc/rc.d, which may require you to reestablish your old
  configuration by hand editing, instead of by copying the old rc
  scripts from your backup.  Once it's all done, reboot.


  16.  Configure and rebuild the linux kernel.

  Even if you don't absolutely have to do this in order to get a kernel
  that supports your hardware, it's worth doing it in order to get a
  kernel that doesn't contain masses of drivers for stuff your machine
  doesn't have.  For details, see the Kernel HOWTO.  Install the rebuilt
  kernel on a floppy at first; once that boots ok, install on the hard
  disk, run lilo if you're using it, and reboot.


  17.  Restore the stuff from the backups you made earlier.

  Some of the binaries may need to be reinstalled from the source
  directories; I had to do that with lilo, for example, since my version
  was newer than the one on the Slackware installation and I hadn't
  bothered to save the binary from /sbin.  You'll want to check through
  your restored programs and confirm the existence and correctness of
  configuration files, libraries and so on.  In some cases, you may have
  to restore things in a specific order; you did make notes during
  backup, didn't you? ;-)


  18.  Review security.

  Check file permissions and directory permissions to be sure that
  access is neither too restricted nor too easy.  I find that Slackware
  tends to lean toward a more open environment than I like, so I go
  around changing 755's to 711's for binaries in the .../bin directories
  and stuff like that.  Or even 700's in the .../sbin ones.  Especial
  care is needed if you've carried over an ftp server; but then, if you
  were running an ftp server, you probably thought of that already. :)


  19.  Enable logins.

  You're up and running.  Over the next little while, there'll probably
  be details to clean up; but the bulk of the work is done.  Enjoy!
