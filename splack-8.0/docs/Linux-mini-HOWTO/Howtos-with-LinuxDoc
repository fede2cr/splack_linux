  Howtos-with-LinuxDoc-mini-HOWTO
  David S. Lawyer
  v0.01, March 2001

  This is about how to write HOWTOs using the simple LinuxDoc markup.
  It's primarily for Linux Documentation Project authors (and future
  fledging authors who want to get started fast).  If you want to use
  the more advanced DocBook markup (including XML) see the LDP Authoring
  Guide.

  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  Can you write a HOWTO ?

  Do you have info about Linux that would be useful to others?  Can you
  write clearly?  Do you know how to use a word processor or editor?  Do
  you want to help thousands of others and let them read what you write
  at no cost to them?  Once you've written a document, are you willing
  to receive email suggestions from readers and selectively use this
  info for improving your HOWTO?  Would you like to have your writings
  be available on hundreds of websites throughout the world?  If you can
  answer yes to these, then you're encouraged to write something for the
  LDP.  But be warned that all this may take more time than you
  expected.

  1.3.  Why I wrote this

  Why did I write this when there is already an "LDP Authoring Guide"?
  Well, the LDP guide is a long and detailed work.  If you want to get
  started quickly, you need something much simpler and shorter.
  Furthermore the LDP guide fails to even mention the simplicity of
  LinuxDoc.  Need I say more?

  Thanks to Matt Welsh for his example.sgml file which I used as a major
  source of info for the example sections.


  2.  The Format of HOWTOs

  2.1.  Introduction

  Our HOWTOs are released in various formats: Plain Text, HTML,
  PostScript, and PDF.  Instead of having to write the same HOWTO in all
  of these formats we write just one HOWTO in a source format which gets
  converted by computer into all of the others.

  To get an idea of what this format looks like, take a look at the
  source file of a webpage (if you haven't already).  You will see all
  sorts of words in <angle brackets>.  These are called tags.  These
  webpages (tags and all) are html: Hypertext Markup Language.  The LDP
  uses something like this for its documents.

  The languages LDP uses meet the requirements of the Standard
  Generalized Markup Language or SGML for short.  The LDP now uses the
  following two flavors of sgml: LinuxDoc and DocBook.  Originally it
  only used LinuxDoc (which was sometimes incorrectly just called sgml).
  Interestingly, it turns out that html is still another flavor of sgml.
  Now some people have gone from the DocBook flavor of sgml to the
  DocBook flavor of the XML standard.

  This mini-HOWTO is all about using the simple LinuxDoc flavor of sgml.
  You may call it "LinuxDoc markup".  It can be machine converted to
  html, plain text, postscript, pdf, and DocBook.  It's a lot easier
  than html or DocBook and you don't need a special editor for it as
  it's easy to type in the tags (or use macros for them).

  3.  Comparing LinuxDoc to DocBook

  One way to do this is to go to the LDP site  <http://www.linuxdoc.org>
  click on HOWTOs and then compare the sources of the same HOWTO in the
  two formats: LinuxDoc and DocBook.  The DocBook tags are often longer
  than the equivalent LinuxDoc tags and there are sometimes more of them
  needed to do the same task.  DocBook uses <para> and </para> tags to
  enclose each paragraph while LinuxDoc uses only a blank line to
  separate paragraphs (no tags).  To emphasize the word "release" the
  comparison is:



       <emphasis>release</emphasis> release
       <em>release</em>



  Yes, you have to type release twice in DocBook.  For a section start:


       <sect>
       <title>Introduction<title>

       <sect> Introduction



  So there's much more to type with DocBook if you're typing in tags
  manually.  But DocBook has all sorts of tags that don't exist in
  LinuxDoc so it's more advanced.  Just using a subset of DocBook
  doesn't help as you can see from the above examples.  There is still a
  lot more tag clutter.  With a more and longer tags the document
  becomes harder to read unless you use an editor that hides them.  But
  hiding them has it's drawbacks since it's nice to see what tags you've
  used.

  Still, the number of people who use DocBook greatly exceeds the number
  using LinuxDoc.  But if you do decide to migrate to DocBook there's a
  program by Reuben Thomas (ld2db) which can help make the conversion.
  It's not 100% perfect and you may have to do some manual editing.  The
  LDP also automatically converts a LinuxDoc HOWTO to DocBook after you
  submit it.


  4.  Learning LinuxDoc

  4.1.  Introduction

  LinuxDoc is a lot easier to learn than DocBook.  But most of what you
  learn about LinuxDoc would also be useful for DocBook.  So if you
  eventually decide to go for DocBook, most of the effort spent on
  learning LinuxDoc will not be wasted.

  One way to learn it is by examples.  I've written 3 example files
  ranging from easy to intermediate.  Start with example1. These files
  are included here as sections.  To turn them into individual files you
  may cut them out and write them to files.  Then you could try turning
  one into text by using say "sgml2txt -f example2.sgml" to see what it
  looks like.  Make sure the file names end in .sgml.

  If you want to look at some real examples you can just go to an LDP
  mirror site, find the HOWTOs and select LinuxDoc SGML.  Or go to the
  main site directly:
  <http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/sgml> Now
  for the first simple example.


  4.2.  Example 1



       <!doctype linuxdoc system>
       <article>
       <title>First Example (example1)
       <author>David S.Lawyer

       <sect> Introduction
       <p> This is a very simple example of "source" for the LinuxDoc text
       formatting system.  This paragraph begins with a paragraph tag (a "p"
       enclosed in angle brackets).  Notice that there are other tags, also
       enclosed in angle brackets.  If you don't see any tags, then you are
       reading a converted file so find the source file: example1.sgml (which
       contains the tags).

       This is the next paragraph.  Note that it is separated from the above
       paragraph by just a blank line.  Thus it needs no "p" tag in front of
       it.  The "p" tag is only needed for the first paragraph of a section
       (just after the sect-tag).  The file suffix: sgml stands for Standard
       Generalized Markup Language.  You are now reading the LinuxDoc flavor
       of sgml as specified in the very first line of this file.

       <sect> Tags
       <p> Tags are anything inside angle brackets.  The "sect" tag above
       marks the start of a new section of this example document.
       "Introduction" was the first section and you are now reading the
       second section titled "Tags".  If this were a long document (like a
       book), a section would correspond to a chapter.

       Note that there are "article", "title" and "author" tags at the start
       of this article.  At the end of this article is an "/article" tag
       marking the end of this article.  Thus there is a pair of "article"
       tags, the first being the start tag and the second being the end tag.
       Thus this entire article is enclosed in "article" tags.  In later
       examples you'll see that there are other tags that come in pairs like
       this.   They affect whatever is between the pairs (start tag and end
       tag).  Any tag name which has "/" just before it is an "end tag".

       When this source code is converted to another format (such as plain
       text using the program sgml2txt) the tags are removed.  Tags only help
       the sgml2txt program make the conversion.  There are more tags to
       learn.  So once you understand this example1, please go on to the next
       example: example2.  You don't need to actually memorize the tags, as
       they will be repeated (but with little or no explanation) in later
       examples.
       </article>



  4.3.  Example 2



  <!-- This is a comment.  It's ignored when this source file gets
  converted to other formats.  -->
  <!-- The next required tag implies that this file is in LinuxDoc format -->
  <!doctype linuxdoc system>

  <article>

  <title>Second Example (example2)
  <author>David S. Lawyer
  <date>v1.0, July 2000

  <abstract>
  This is the abstract.  This document is the second example of using
  the Linuxdoc-SGML flavor of sgml.  It's more complex than the first
  example (example1.sgml) but simpler than the third example
  (example3.sgml).  After you digest this you'll be able to write a
  simple HOWTO using LinuxDoc.  End of the abstract.
  </abstract>

  <!-- The "toc" = Table of Contents.   It will be created here. -->
  <toc>

  <!-- Begin the main part of the article (or document) here.  The part
  above this is sort of a long header. -->

  <sect>This Second Example (example2.sgml)

  <p>Unless you're familiar with markup languages, you should first
  read example1.sgml.  You may want to run these example files thru a
  translator such as sgml2txt to convert them to text and notice how the
  result looks different than this "source" document with all its tags.

  <sect>Article Layout
  <sect1>Document Header
  <p> One way to create a header part is just to copy them from another
  .sgml file.  Then replace everything except the tags with the correct
  info for your document.  This is like using a "template".

  <sect1> Document Body
  <p>
  After the header comes the body of the document, consisting of nested
  sections marked by sect-tags.  Subsections are marked by sect1-tags.
  Since this is the first subsection within the 2nd main section, it's
  actually section 2.1.  Within a subsection there may be
  sub-subsections marked by sect2-tags, etc.  For a sub-sub-sub-section
  use "sect3".  There are even such tags as sect4 and sect5, but you are
  unlikely to need them.

  <sect2> This is a sub-sub-section
  <p>
  It's 2.2.1.  Note that a "p" tag may be on a line by itself.  This
  doesn't change a thing in the resulting documents.

  <sect> More Features in example3
  <p> With the tags in this example2 you can write a simple short document
  a few pages long.  But for longer documents or for other important
  features such as putting links into documents, you need to study the
  next example: example3.  It will show you how to create lists and
  fonts.

  4.4.  Example 3

  on it to send me email -->

  <article>
  <title>Third Example (example3)
  <author>David S. Lawyer <url url="mailto:dave@lafn.org">
  <date>v1.0, July 2000
  <abstract>
  This document is the third example of using the LinuxDoc flavor of sgml.
  It's more complex than the second example.
  </abstract>
  <!-- Comment: toc = Table of Contents  -->
  <toc>

  <sect> Fonts
  <p>
  While they will not show up in a plain text output, they will work
  for other conversions.
  <bf>boldface font</bf>   <em>emphasis font</em>     <sf>sans serif</sf>
  <sl>slanted font</sl>    <tt>typewriter font</tt>   <it>italics font</it>
  There's another way to get these same fonts by enclosing
  the text in slashes like this:
  <bf/boldface font/    <em/emphasis font/      <sf/sans serif/
  <sl/slanted font/     <tt/typewriter font/    <it/italics font/

  <sect> Links <label id="links_">
  <p> You may create links (something that html browsers may click on to
  go somewhere else).  They might just go to another part of this
  document (cross-references) or they could get to a website on the
  Internet.

  <sect1> Cross-References
  <p> If you click on <ref id="links_" name="Links"> you will be taken to
  the start of the "Links" section above (which is labeled links_).
  The label id may be any word you choose but it's a good idea to avoid
  common words so that you can search for unique labels using your
  editor.  That's why I use links_ (with the underline).  The name of
  this link will be shown (in html format) as the name to click on.
  This name (Links) will also be present in the text rendition.

  <sect1> URL Links
  <p> If you click on <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org"> you will get
  to the Linux Documentation Project website.  The next link adds a name
  which people will click on: <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org"
  name="Linux Documentation Project">.  Using this second method, you may
  not even need to explain where the link leads to since it's obvious by
  the name.

  <sect> Prohibited Characters
  <p> Anything you type between angle bracket will be interpreted as a
  tag.  But what if you want to display a tag in a document?  For this
  you use a code word for the angle characters.

  You may use &lt for < and &gt for >.  lt = Less Than, gt =
  Greater Than.  For example, here's a p-tag: &lt;p&gt;.  Of
  course it doesn't actually start any paragraph, but it will appear in
  the converted document as <p>.  These codes all start with an &
  character.  The ; after the lt is to separate it.  It's not needed if
  there is a space after it.  For example: 3 &lt 4.  Actually, if
  you know that its OK to use an unpaired > then you could have written
  <p> as &lt;p>.  This will not be mistakenly recognized as a tag
  since there is no opening <.

  There are other characters that you can't put into the document text
  directly.  For & in an AT modem command use: AT&amp;.  If other
  characters cause you trouble see example3 or the "guide" that comes
  with linuxdoc-tools or sgml-tools.

  <sect> Verbatim, Code & Newline
  <sect1> Verbatim
  <p> If you want to insure that lines are not joined together during
  conversion to other formats, use verbatim (verb).  Some things still
  get recognized even though they are between verbatim tags.  This
  includes the macros starting with & and end tags with /.

  <tscreen><verb>
  % sgml2txt -f example.sgml
  </verb></tscreen>
  The "tscreen" sets the font to typewriter and indents it nicely.

  <sect1> Code
  <p> This encloses computer code between two dashed lines.
  <tscreen><code>
  Put computer source code here
  </code></tscreen>

  <sect1> Newline
  <p> To force a newline use <newline>
  This sentence always starts at the left margin.

  <sect>Lists
  <p>
  This puts items into a list with a marker at the start of each item.
  They start with the "itemize" tag.
  <itemize>
  <item> This is the first item in a list.
  <item> This is the second item
         <itemize>
         <item> Multiple levels (nesting) are supported.
         <item> The second item in this sublist
         </itemize>
         <enum>
         <item> Enumerated lists using <tt/enum/ also work.
         <item> This is item number 2
         </enum>
  <item> The final item in the main list
  </itemize>
  </article>

       <toc> <!-- Comment: toc = Table of Contents  -->



  4.5.2.  Body Layout



       <sect> Chapter 1            Note: Put a <p> on the first line of
       <sect1> Subsection 1.1      each section (or subsection, etc.)

  4.5.6.  Newline, Verbatim, URLs



  To force a newline <newline>
  <tscreen><verb>
  <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org">
  <url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org" name="Linux Documentation Project">.
  </verb></tscreen>



  4.5.7.  Character Codes (macros).



    Use &amp; for the ampersand (&),

    Use &lt; for a left bracket (<),

    Use &gt; for a right bracket (>),

    Use &etago; for a left bracket with a slash (</)

    Use &dollar; for a dollar sign ($),

    Use &num; for a hash (#),

    Use &percnt; for a percent (%),

    Use &tilde; for a tilde (~),

    Use `` and '' for quotes, or use &dquot; for ".

    Use &shy; for a soft hyphen (that is, an indication that this is a
     good place to break a word for horizontal justification).


  5.  Getting/Using the LinuxDoc Software

  You could write a LinuxDoc document without having any LinuxDoc
  software.  However it's likely that it would contain some errors in
  the tags (or their use) so that it would be returned to you for
  correction.  Even if there were no errors, the results likely would
  not look quite right.  So it's best for you to have the software to
  convert your source code on your computer.

  The Debian distribution of Linux has a linuxdoc-tools package.  There
  is also a rpm package for non-Debian distributions.  It was formerly
  called sgml-tools and version 1.0.9 (the final one) may still be
  useful if you can't get linuxdoc-tools.  Don't use the sgmltools-2
  package which is primarily for DocBook.

  To use it, you run converter programs on the *.sgml files.  For
  example, type: "sgml2txt -f my-HOWTO.sgml".  To get html type:
  "sgml2html my-HOWTO.sgml".  If it shows errors, it will show the line
  number and the column number where the error is in the source file.
  Typing "man -k sgml" should show you a number of other programs with a
  one-line description of each.


  6.  Writing the HOWTO

  6.1.  Before you start writing

  First email the HOWTO coordinator at  <mailto:linux-
  howto@metalab.unc.edu> or  <mailto:feedback@linuxdoc.org>.  If you're
  taking over an unmaintained HOWTO, contact the former author.  This
  may required by the copyright-license but you should do it out of
  courtesy even it it's not required.


  6.2.  Guidelines

  These are mostly by Tim Bynum (a former HOWTO coordinator).

    Be sure and use an accepted format (such as LinuxDoc :-).

    Try to use meaningful structure and organization, and write
     clearly. Remember that many of the people reading HOWTOs do not
     speak English as their first language.

    Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't stress
     this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
     you're only guessing.  I use ?? if I'm not sure.

    Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
     available software.

    Consider including a "FAQ" section.  It might also be called
     "Common Problems" or "Trouble Shooting".

    Be sure to copyright it in your name and include a license which
     meets the requirements stated in the LDP manifesto.

    Use the standard header with title, author, and date (including a
     version number).  See ``Example 3''

    Lastly, be prepared to receive email questions and comments from
     readers.  How much you help people is up to you but you should make
     use of good suggestions and reports of errors.  You may also get
     some "thank you" email as well as well as mail from people asking
     for help who never even looked at your HOWTO.


  6.3.  Submitting the HOWTO, etc.

  After you have written the HOWTO, email the SGML source to
  submit@linuxdoc.org.  Then all you need to do is to keep the HOWTO up-
  to date by submitting periodic updates to the same email as you used
  for the first edition.


  7.  More Information

  There's a forthcoming HOWTO about LinuxDoc that covers it in much
  greater detail than this mini-HOWTO.  To be released sometime in April
  2001 ??
