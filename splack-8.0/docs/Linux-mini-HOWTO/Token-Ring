  v4.1, 7 January 1998

  This howto is designed to help you install the kernel patch and also
  try to point out some things to look for. I suggest that you at least
  browse through all of this document before attempting to install any
  part of the Token Ring driver for Linux.

  however, please notify me so that I can make sure that you have the
  most current information available.

  2.  Hardware requirements

  Make sure that you have a Token Ring card that is supported by this
  driver.  Currently the only cards that are supported are those that
  use the Tropic chipset.

  Cards that I personally know to work are:

  ·  3Com 3C619B Token Link

  ·  3Com 3C619C Token Link

  ·  HyperRing Classic 16/4

  ·  IBM Turbo 16/4 ISA adapter**

  ·  IBM Token Ring Auto 16/4 ISA adapter

  ·  IBM Token Ring Auto 16/4 adapter /A

  ·  IBM Token Ring 16/4 adapter /A

  ·  IBM Token Ring adapter /A

  ·  IBM Token Ring adapter II (4 Megabit only)

  ·  IBM 16/4 ISA Token Ring card (16bit)

  ·  IBM 16/4 ISA Token Ring card (8bit)

  ·  Madge Blue (100% IBM compatable)

     All other 100% IBM compatable shared-ram adapters should also work
     fine.  Please let us know if you find differently.

  It is recommended that you use 16KB Shared RAM for the time being.

  Cards that may cause problems:

     IBM Turbo 16/4 ISA adapter
        This adapter will, in fact, work fine with the Linux token ring
        driver.  However, you MUST run the card in Auto 16/4
        compatability mode.  The simplest way to set this is to use the
        LANAID disks sent with the card and run the command:


          LANAIDC /FAST=AUTO16



     You should then use LANAIDC or LANAID to configure the card accord­
     ing to documentation.


     Token-Ring Network 16/4 Adapter II
        This adapter will NOT work.  Do not confuse this card with the
        IBM Token Ring adapter II (4mbit) which does. It is a
        DMA/Busmaster adapter for ISA.


     3Com TokenLink Velocity ISA
        You may or may not get this one to work.  I have had reports of
        people running it without problems, and others who get errors
        left and right.


     PCI adapters
        Currently, none of the IBM PCI adapters are supported.


     IBM Auto LanStreamer 16/4 Token-Ring PCI Adapter
        Currently not supported, but being worked on.  This driver
        should be Full Duplex as well when completed.

  3.  Software needed


     NOTE:
        If you are running a 2.0 distribution of Linux, please jump to
        the distriubtion specific section of this document.  The
        following is mostly for 1.2 kernels.

  This assumes you already have Linux up and running.

  Obtain the Token Ring patch from:

       <ftp://ftp.wayne.esu1.k12.ne.us/pub/Linux/Token-Ring/Token­
       Ring.patch-1.2.0.gz>


  Obtain the NetTools patched source from:

       <ftp://ftp.wayne.esu1.k12.ne.us/pub/Linux/Token-Ring/net-
       tools-1.2.0.patched.tar.gz>


  Create a directory for the patches (such as /usr/src/patches) and
  place the patches there.


       mkdir /usr/src/patches             central directory for patch storage
       mkdir /usr/src/patches/token       place TokenRing patch here



  4.  Installation and setup


     NOTE:
        These instructions are for patching a 1.2 kernel for token ring
        support.  If you have a 2.0 kernel, you only need to recompile
        the current source and say ``yes'' or ``module'' when asked for
        token ring support.


  1. Install the Token Ring card into the system and configure it for
     the settings that you want to use.  It is a good idea to see if you
     can use the card through DOS before trying to use it through Linux.
     If it works in DOS, chances are, it will work in Linux with the
     same settings. If you have a Plug and Play adapter, if possible,
     lock the settings once you get them where they work.

  2. Make a backup of your linux directory.  This is very important in
     case you need to totally remove the source of the patch from your
     kernel and go back to your original code.


       cd /usr/src
       tar cvzhf linuxbak.tar.gz linux



  3. Uncompress the TokenRing patch.


       cd /usr/src/patches/token
       gzip -d TokenRing.patch-1.2.0.gz



  4. Modify your kernel with the TokenRing patch.


       cd /usr/src/linux
       patch -p1 < /usr/src/patches/token/TokenRing.patch-1.2.0



  -or-


       patch -p1 < <directory-of-patchfile>/TokenRing.patch-1.2.0



  5. Search your kernel for any rejects from the patch and make changes
     as necessary.


       find . -name \*.rej -print



  6. Search your kernel for the orig files and remove them.


       find . -name \*.orig -print | xargs rm



  7. Configure your kernel and remake.

     NOTE:
        Make sure your swap space is active if you have one.



       cd /usr/src/linux
       make config



  (The patch should have added two lines to your config.in file for the
  following options)


       Token Ring support (CONFIG_TR) [y]



  (and further down the list...)


       IBM Tropic chipset based adaptor support (CONFIG_IBMTR) [y]



       make dep
       make clean
       make zImage



  8. Setup LILO.

     First rename your /vmlinuz kernel to vmlinuz.old then copy the
     kernel to /vmlinuz.  On my system this would consist of copying

       /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage to /vmlinuz and editing
       /etc/lilo.conf to boot that kernel.


  Now from the prompt run ``lilo''.

  9. You should now be able to reboot your system and use the Token Ring
     card in your computer.  Please check the distribution specifc
     section for any extra configuration information.

  5.  NetTools installation

  The NetTools package contains a lot of the basic utils that you will
  use to communicate with network devices.  This includes programs like
  arp, rarp, route, ifconfig and netstat.  Since these programs do not
  know about Token Ring by default, you will need to add the NetTools
  patch so these utilities can work more efficiently with the Token Ring
  driver.

     NOTICE:
        The current version of NetTools for 1.2.x kernels is 1.2.0.  If
        you are running a 2.0 kernel, your nettools is most likely
        already up to date.  However, you can get the latest source
        from:

          <ftp://tapac.inka.de/pub/comp/Linux/networking/NetTools/>



  1. (1) Copy and Untar the NetTools source into your source directory.


       cp net-tools-1.2.0.patched.tar.gz  /usr/src
       tar -zxvof /usr/src/net-tools-1.2.0.tar.gz



  2. (5) Make the net-tools files.


       cd /usr/src/net
       make install



  6.  Known problems

  I personally have had very few problems with this driver.  It has been
  working perfectly for me for quite some time.

  If you have any problems with the driver on a 1.2.x kernel, please
  update to Linux 2.0.  The current version, as of this writing, is
  2.0.33.  There have been many improvements to the token ring driver
  since the 1.2 patches and most of them have not been ported back.

  Also, you will not have to patch a Linux 2.0 kernel for token ring.
  The source is already included.  However, there are some test patches
  of the code going into 2.1 available if you would like to use it.

  7.  Questions and comments


     Q: Can the token ring driver be compiled as a module?

     A: Yes, it can be -- and it works rather well.  There is an extra
        parameter that you can use when it is compiled as a module.  If
        you ever need to ``spoof'' software install programs, such as
        the redhat boot disks, into configuring your token ring card as
        an ethernet device (for NFS/FTP installs, etc), you can use the
        ``device'' parameter to force a device name other then tr0.  You
        will probably have problems if you try this with multiple
        adapters.  It is mostly there to get around a few
        incompatabiliites. Ex.:


          /sbin/insmod ibmtr device=eth0


     Q: I keep getting an error code ``0011''.  Whats up?

     A: Make sure that your connection to the network is good or that
        you have a loopback connector on your token ring card.  This
        message just means that it could not open the ring.  99.99% of
        the times, it is just not plugged into one.


     C: If you have a sound card in your machine, and it sits at IO
        0x220, you may end up with a conflict with your token ring
        adapter at 0xa20.  If you notice that a supported adapter does
        not seem to be working and you have a sound card, please try to
        either set your token ring card to 0xa24 or move/remove your
        sound card.

        Also...

        Here are some email messages that I have received about Token
        Ring and Linux.  In some of the messages, I have removed parts
        that were not important to save space.

        Q:


             From: "Mr. Chuck Rickard" <chuck@gl.umbc.edu>
             Subject: Re: Token Ring Kernel patch

             I d/l'd the patch, applied it, and re-compiled. When booting it said,
             "tr0: Can't assign device to adapter" and again for tr1.  Any ideas?

             Thanks!

             Chuck Rickard
             (chuck@umbc8.umbc.edu)



        A:


             From: David Morris <dwm@shell.portal.com>



        When this is the only message issued, it means that the PIO
        request for adapter information (see segment = inb(PIOaddr) in
        ibmtr.c) was so out of range that there is no TR card at that IO
        address.


        Q:



        From: Mike Glover <glover@credit.erin.utoronto.ca>
        Subject: Token ring problems.

        Thanks for responding. I was starting to thing that I posted incorrectly,
        and I was about to post again. Anyway, the following  clip is part of my
        /var/adm/messages file from when I boot up.

        May  2 10:03:14 linux kernel: tr0: Unable to assign adapter to device.
        May  2 10:03:14 linux kernel: tr1: Unable to assign adapter to device.

        The section, tr0: Unable to assign adapter device. is what kinda confuses
        me. The documentation is slim at best so I didn't know what to do with
        the message. I know I didn't assign any token ring information,
        and I didn't know where to do it.

        The hardware:
                    Its a PC clone (Dell OMNIPLEX 560 to be exact)
                    The token ring card is a Olicom 16/4 Adapter.

        I have DOS token ring drivers and it snaps into the network, so there is
        nothing wrong with the card. I think, I am just missing something really
        small in the config on the Linux side.



        A: The Olicom 16/4 Adapter does not use the Tropic Chipset.  Try
           using one of the cards that are listed at the top of the
           HOWTO.


        Q:


             From: Mike Glover <glover@credit.erin.utoronto.ca>
             Subject: Found an IBM card...

             I found myself an IBM token ring card and I got a little further,
             but still not luck. (I did change /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 ifconfig entry
             from eth0 to tr0)

             Anyway, here is part of the /var/adm/messages file:
             May  2 16:23:07 linux kernel: IPX Portions Copyright (c) 1995 Caldera, Inc.

             Does this tell you anything. It tells me little.



        A:

        From: David Morris <dwm@shell.portal.com>



        This message means either a memory conflict with the MMIO area
        or a TR card which is not compatible with the driver (at least
        the signature isn't known).


        Q:


             From: Mike Glover <glover@credit.erin.utoronto.ca>
             Subject: Almost there...

             The following sample is what I'm getting on my messages file:

             May  3 14:50:24 linux kernel: tr0: now opening the board...
             May  3 14:50:24 linux kernel: tr0: board opened...

             May  3 15:11:47 linux kernel:  ring is very busy, so we just wait a little longer

                Donald resets adapter, but resetting

             The Arrg entry only comes when I telnet, rlogin or ftp to a remote
             machine. Once that happens, the connection hangs big time. I took out all
             the other hardware (which was 1 SCSI card) and tried running the card all
             by itself. Same thing, so it eliminates hardware IRQ's from getting into
             a yelling match. The following are the DIP switches on the card:

             1       Up      |
             2       Down    |
             3       Down    |       According to the manual this sets the
             4       Up      |       base address to CC000 Which is fine for
             5       Up      |       my machine.
             6       Down    |
             7       Down    +       This sets the IRQ to 2. Which is also fine
             8       Down    +
             9       Up      X       Primary Lan adapter. Which it is.
             10      Up      =       16 KB shared RAM size. This OK?
             11      Down    =
             12      Up      #       16 Mbps Data rate.

             I was wondering if it is in fact the dip switches, or the way I have
             configured my route table and other network info.

             ttfn,
             Mike



        A: The Arrg problem is pretty much taken care of in the 2.0
           kernels.  All of the patches have not been ported back to
           1.2, and I doubt that they will be.  If you get excessive
           Arrg messages, do yourself a favour and move to Linux 2.0.

  8.  Distribution Specific Installations

  8.1.  Slackware 96

  If you have not already ran ``netconfig'' on your system, do so now.
  Setup your machine just as if it were on Ethernet.

  Edit your /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 scripts to point to the tr0 device rather
  than the eth0 device.

  You should have a line that looks like


       /sbin/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK}



  Change this line to read


       /sbin/ifconfig tr0 ${IPADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK}



  8.2.  RedHat 4.0+

  The RedHat distribution of Linux has a wonderful Xwindows control
  panel for configuring modules and devices. If you have added a token
  ring adapter to a standard RedHat installation, there should already
  be token ring support compiled in as a module.  Try to:


       modprobe ibmtr



  and see what you come up with.  Chances are, if you have a supported
  adapter, you will be ready to go.

  The easiest way to configure your interface would be to use the
  control-panel.  You will first want to go to the kernel module control
  and instruct it to load a new network device for token ring.  It
  should then start to autoload the ibmtr driver on boot.  You will then
  want to jump over to network configuration and add a new device, tr,
  and give it an ip address, etc.

  You should then be able to restart and go with Linux and Token Ring on
  RedHat 4.0+.

  Please note that these RedHat instructions came from the top of my
  head.  I havn't had to modify any of my RedHat systems for quite some
  time and am writing this from memory.  Either way, they should be able
  to get you where you need to go.
