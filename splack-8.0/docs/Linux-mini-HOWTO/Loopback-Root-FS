  2.  Principles of Loopback Devices and Ramdisks

  First I will describe some of the general principles that are used in
  the setting up of a loopback filesystem as the root device.



  2.1.  Loopback Devices

  A loopback device in Linux is a virtual device that can be used like
  any other media device.


  Examples of normal media devices are hard disk partitions like
  /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2, /dev/sda1, or entire disks like the floppy disk
  /dev/fd0 etc.  They are all devices that can be used to hold a files
  and directory structures.  They can be formatted with the filesystem
  that is required (ext2fs, msdos, ntfs etc.) and then mounted.


  The loopback filesystem associates a file on another filesystem as a
  complete device.  This can then be formatted and mounted just like any
  of the other devices listed above.  To do this the device called
  /dev/loop0 or /dev/loop1 etc is associated with the file and then this
  new virtual device is mounted.



  2.2.  Ramdisk Devices

  In Linux it is also possible to have another type of virtual device
  mounted as a filesystem, this is the ramdisk device.


  In this case the device does not refer to any physical hardware, but
  to a portion of memory that is set aside for the purpose.  The memory
  that is allocated is never swapped out to disk, but remains in the
  disk cache.


  A ramdisk can be created at any time by writing to the ramdisk device
  /dev/ram0 or /dev/ram1 etc.  This can then be formatted and mounted in
  the same way that the loopback device is.


  When a ramdisk is used to boot from (as is often done on Linux
  installation disks or rescue disks) then the disk image (the entire
  contents of the disk as a single file) can be stored on the boot
  floppy in a compressed form.  This is automatically recognised by the
  kernel when it boots and is uncompressed into the ramdisk before it is
  mounted.



  2.3.  The Initial Ramdisk Device

  The initial ramdisk device in Linux is another important mechanism
  that we need to be able to use a loopback device as a the root
  filesystem.


  When the initial ramdisk is used the filesystem image is copied into
  memory and mounted so that the files on it can be accessed.  A program
  on this ramdisk (called /linuxrc) is run and when it is finished a
  different device is mounted as the root filesystem.  The old ramdisk
  is still present though and is mounted on the directory /initrd if
  present or available through the device /dev/initrd.


  This is unusual behaviour since the normal boot sequence boots from
  the designated root partition and keeps on running.  With the initial
  ramdisk option the root partition is allowed to change before the main
  boot sequence is started.



  2.4.  The Root Filesystem

  The root filesystem is the device that is mounted first so that it
  appears as the directory called / after booting.


  There are a number of complications about the root filesystem that are
  due to the fact that it contains all files.  When booting the rc
  scripts are run, these are either the files in /etc/rc.d or /etc/rc?.d
  depending on the version of the /etc/init program.


  When the system has booted it is not possible to unmount the root
  partition or change it since all programs will be using it to some
  extent.  This is why the initial ramdisk is so useful because it can
  be used so that the final root partition is not the same as the one
  that is loaded at boot time.



  2.5.  The Linux Boot Sequence

  To show how the initial ramdisk operates in the boot sequence, the
  order of events is listed below.



  1. The kernel is loaded into memory, this is performed by LILO or
     LOADLIN.  You can see the Loading... message as this happens.

  2. The ramdisk image is loaded into memory, again this is performed by
     LILO or LOADLIN. You can see the Loading... message again as this
     happens.

  3. The kernel is initialised, including parsing the command line
     options and setting of the ramdisk as the root device.

  4. The program /linuxrc is run on the initial ramdisk.

  5. The root device is changed to that specified in the kernel
     parameter.

  6. The init program /etc/init is run which will perform the user
     configurable boot sequence.

  This is just a simplified version of what happens, but is sufficient
  to explain how the kernel starts up and where the initial ramdisk is
  used.



  3.  How To Create a Loopback Root Device

  Now that the general principles are explained the method of creating
  the loopback device can be explained.



  3.1.  Requirements

  To create the loopback root device will require a number of things.



    A working Linux system.

    A way to copy large files onto the target DOS partition.

  Most important is access to an installed Linux system.  This is
  because the loop device can only be created under Linux.  This will
  mean that it is not possible to bootstrap a working system from
  nothing.  The requirements of the Linux system that you use is that
  you can compile a kernel on it.


  Once the loopback device is created it will be a large file.  I have
  used an 80 MB files, but while this was sufficient for an X terminal
  it may not be enough if you want to use it for much else.  This file
  must be copied onto the DOS partition, so either a network or a lot of
  floppy disks must be used.


  The software that you will require includes


    LOADLIN version 1.6 or above

    A version of mount that supports loopback devices

    A version of the kernel that supports the required options.

  All of these should be standard for recent Linux installations.



  3.2.  Creating the Linux Kernel

  I created the loopback device using Linux kernel version 2.0.31, other
  versions should also work, but they must have at least the options
  listed below.


  The kernel options that you will need to enable are the following:

    RAM disk support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM).

    Initial RAM disk (initrd) support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD).

    Loop device support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP).

    fat fs support (CONFIG_FAT_FS).

    msdos fs support (CONFIG_MSDOS_FS).

  The first two are for the RAM disk device itself and the initial ram
  disk device.  The next one is the loop back filesystem option.  The
  last two are the msdos filesystem support which is required to mount
  the DOS partitition.


  Compiling a kernel without modules is the easiest option, although if
  you do want modules then it should be possible although I have not
  tried it.  If modules are used then you should make sure that you have
  the options above compiled in and not as modules themselves.


  Depending on the kernel version that you have you may need to apply a
  kernel patch.  It is a very simple one that allows the loopback device
  to be used as the root filesystem.

    Kernel versions before 2.0.0; I have no information about these.

    Kernel version 2.0.0 to 2.0.34; you need to apply the kernel patch
     for 2.0.x kernels as shown below.

    Kernel version 2.0.35 to 2.0.x; no kernel patch is required.

    Kernel version 2.1.x; you need to apply the kernel patch for 2.0.x
     or 2.2.x kernels as shown below, depending on the exact 2.1.x
     version.

    Kernel version 2.2.0 to 2.2.10; you need to apply the kernel patch
     for 2.2.x kernels as shown below.

    Kernel version 2.3.x; you need to apply the kernel patch for 2.2.x
     kernels as shown below.


  For 2.0.x kernels the file /init/main.c needs to have a single line
  added to it as shown by the modified version below.  The line that
  says "loop", 0x0700 is the one that was added.



  static void parse_root_dev(char * line)
  {
          int base = 0;
          static struct dev_name_struct {
                  const char *name;
                  const int num;
          } devices[] = {
                  { "nfs",     0x00ff },
                  { "loop",    0x0700 },
                  { "hda",     0x0300 },

  ...

                  { "sonycd",  0x1800 },
                  { NULL, 0 }
          };

  ...

  }



  For 2.2.x kernels the file /init/main.c needs to have three lines
  added to it as shown by the modified version below.  The line that
  says "loop", 0x0700 and the ones either side of it are the ones that
  were added.



       static struct dev_name_struct {
               const char *name;
               const int num;
       } root_dev_names[] __initdata = {
       #ifdef CONFIG_ROOT_NFS
               { "nfs",     0x00ff },
       #endif
       #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP
               { "loop",    0x0700 },
       #endif
       #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
               { "hda",     0x0300 },

       ...

               { "ddv", DDV_MAJOR << 8},
       #endif
               { NULL, 0 }
       };



  Once the kernel is configured it should be compiled to produce a
  zImage file (make zImage).  This file will be arch/i386/boot/zImage
  when compiled.



  3.3.  Creating the Initial Ramdisk Device

  The initial ramdisk is most easily created as a loopback device from
  the start.  You will need to do this as root, the commands that you
  need to execute are listed below, they are assumed to be run from
  root's home directory (/root).



       mkdir /root/initrd
       dd if=/dev/zero of=initrd.img bs=1k count=1024
       mke2fs -i 1024 -b 1024 -m 5 -F -v initrd.img
       mount initrd.img /root/initrd -t ext2 -o loop
       cd initrd
       [create the files]
       cd ..
       umount /root/initrd
       gzip -c -9 initrd.img > initrdgz.img



  There are a number of steps to this, but they can be described as
  follows.

  1. Create a mount point for the initial ramdisk (an empty directory).

  2. Create an empty file of the size required.  Here I have used
     1024kB, you may need less or more depending on the contents, (the
     size is the last parameter).

  3. Make an ext2 filesystem on the empty file.

  4. Mount the file onto the mount point, this uses the loopback device.

  5. Change to the mounted loopback device.

  6. Create the files that are required (see below for details).

  7. Move out of the mounted loopback device.

  8. Unmount the device.

  9. Create a compressed version for use later.

  Contents Of The Initial Ramdisk

  The files that you will need on the ramdisk are the minimum
  requirements to be able to execute any commands.


    /linuxrc The script that is run to mount the msdos file system (see
     below).

    /lib/* The dynamic linker and the libraries that the programs need.

    /etc/* The cache used by the dynamic linker (not strictly needed,
     but does stop it complaining).

    /bin/* A shell interpreter (ash because it is smaller than bash.
     The mount and losetup programs for handling the DOS disk and
     setting up the loopback devices.

    /dev/* The devices that will be used.  You need /dev/zero for ld-
     linux.so, /dev/hda* to mount the msdos disk and /dev/loop* for the
     lopback device.

    /mnt An empty directory to mount the msdos disk on.

  The initial ramdisk that I used is listed below, the contents come to
  about 800kB when the overhead of the filesystem are taken into
  account.

       total 0

       ./mnt:
       total 0



  The only complex steps about this are the devices in dev.  Use the
  mknod program to create them, use the existing devices in /dev as a
  template to get the required parameters.


  The /linuxrc file

  The /linuxrc file on the initial ramdisk is required to do all of the
  preparations so that the loopback device can be used for the root
  partition when it exits.
  The example below tries to mount /dev/hda1 as an msdos partition and
  if it succeeds then sets up the files /linux/linuxdsk.img as
  /dev/loop0 and /linux/linuxswp.img as /dev/loop1.



       #!/bin/sh

       echo INITRD: Trying to mount /dev/hda1 as msdos

       if /bin/mount -n -t msdos /dev/hda1 /mnt; then

          echo INITRD: Mounted OK
          /bin/losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/linux/linuxdsk.img
          /bin/losetup /dev/loop1 /mnt/linux/linuxswp.img
          exit 0

       else

          echo INITRD: Mount failed
          exit 1

       fi



  The first device /dev/loop0 will become the root device and the second
  one /dev/loop1 will become the swap space.


  If you want to be able to write to the DOS partition as a non-root
  user when you have finished then you should use mount -n -t msdos
  /dev/hda1 /mnt -o uid=0,gid=0,umask=000,quiet instead.  This will map
  all accesses to the DOS partition to root and set the permissions
  appropriately.



  3.4.  Creating The Root Device

  The root device that you will be using is the file linuxdsk.img.  You
  will need to create this in the same way that the initial ramdisk was
  created, but bigger.  You can install any Linux installation that you
  like onto this disk.


  The easiest way might be to copy an existing Linux installation into
  it.  An alternative is to install a new Linux installation onto it.


  Assuming that you have done this, there are some minor changes that
  you must make.


  The /etc/fstab file must reference the root partition and the swap
  using the two loopback devices that are setup on the initial ramdisk.



       /dev/loop0     /      ext2   defaults 1 1
       /dev/loop1     swap   swap   defaults 1 1


  This will ensure that when the real root device is used the kernel
  will not be confused about where the root device is.  It will also
  allow the swap space to be added in the same way a swap partition is
  normally used.  You should remove any other reference to a root disk
  device or swap partition.


  If you want to be able to read the DOS partition after Linux has
  started then you will need to make a number of extra small changes.


  Create a directory called /initrd, this is where the initial ramdisk
  will be mounted once the loopback root filesystem is mounted.

  Create a symbolic link called /DOS that points to /initrd/mnt where
  the real DOS parition will be mounted.

  Add a line into the rc file that mounts the disks.  This should run
  the command mount -f -t msdos /dev/hda1 /initrd/mnt, this will create
  a 'fake' mount of the DOS partition so that all programs (like df)
  will know that the DOS partition is mounted and where to find it.  If
  you used different options in the /linuxrc file that obviously you
  should use them here also.


  There is no need to have a Linux kernel on this root device since that
  is already loaded earlier.  If you are using modules however then you
  should include them on this device as normal.



  3.5.  Creating the Swap Device

  The root device that you will be using is the file linuxswap.img.  The
  swap device is very simple to create.  Create an empty file as was
  done for the initial ramdisk and then run mkswap linuxswap.img to
  intialise it.


  The size of the swap space will depend on what you plan to do with the
  installed system, but I would recommend between 8MB and the amount of
  RAM that you have.



  3.6.  Creating the MSDOS Directory

  The files that are going to be used need to be moved onto the DOS
  partition.


  The files that are required in the DOS directory called C:\LINUX are
  the following:


    LINUXDSK.IMG The disk image that will become the root device.

    LINUXSWP.IMG The swap space.


  3.7.  Creating the Boot Floppy

  The boot floppy that is used is just a normal DOS format bootable
  floppy.


  This is created using format a: /s from DOS.


  Onto this disk you will need to create an AUTOEXEC.BAT file (as below)
  and copy the kernel, compressed initial ramdisk and LOADLIN
  executable.


    AUTOEXEC.BAT The DOS automatically executed batch file.

    LOADLIN.EXE The LOADLIN program executable.

    ZIMAGE The Linux kernel.

    INITRDGZ.IMG The compressed initial ramdisk image.

  The AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain just one line as below.



       \loadlin \zImage initrd=\initrdgz.img root=/dev/loop0 ro



  This specifies the kernel image to use, the initial ramdisk image, the
  root device after the initial ramdisk has finished and that the root
  partition is to be mounted read-only.


  4.  Booting the System

  To boot from this new root device all that is required is that the
  floppy disk prepared as described above is inserted for the PC to boot
  from.


  You will see the following sequence of events.

  1. DOS boots

  2. AUTOEXEC.BAT starts

  3. LOADLIN is run

  4. The Linux kernel is copied into memory

  5. The initial ramdisk is copied into memory

  6. The Linux kernel is started running

  7. The /linuxrc file on the initial ramdisk is run

  8. The DOS partition is mounted and the root and swap devices set up

  9. The boot sequence continues from the loopback device

  When this is complete you can remove the boot floppy and use the Linux
  system.


  4.1.  Possible Problems With Solutions

  There are a number of stages where this process could fail, I will try
  to explain what they are and what to check.

  DOS booting is easy to recognise by the message that it prints MS-DOS
  Starting ... on the screen.  If this is not seen then the floopy disk
  is either not-bootable or the PC is not bootable from the floppy disk
  drive.


  When the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is run the commands in it should be echoed
  to the screen by default.  In this case there is just the single line
  in the file that starts LOADLIN.


  When LOADLIN executes it will do two very visible things, firstly it
  will load the kernel into memory, secondly it will copy the ramdisk
  into memory.  Both of these are indicated by a Loading... message.


  The kernel starts by uncompressing itself, this can give crc errors if
  the kernel image is corrupted.  Then it will start running the
  initialisation sequence which is very verbose with diagnostic
  messages.  Loading of the initial ramdisk device is also visible
  during this phase.


  When the /linuxrc file is run there is no diagnostic messages, but you
  can add these yourself as an aid to debugging.  If this stage fails to
  set up the loopback device as the root device then you may see a
  message that there is no root device and the kernel aborts.


  The normal boot sequence of the new root device will now continue and
  this is quite verbose.  There may be problems about the root device
  being mounted read-write, but the LOADLIN command line option 'ro'
  should stop that.  Other problems that can occur are that the boot
  sequence is confused about where the root device is, this is probably
  due to a problem with /etc/fstab.


  When the boot sequence has completed, the remaining problem is that
  programs are confused about whether the DOS partition is mounted or
  not.  This is why it is a good idea to use the fake mount command
  described earlier.  This makes life a lot easier if you want to access
  the files on the DOS device.



  4.2.  Reference Documents

  The documents that I used to create my first loopback root filesystem
  were:



    The Linux kernel source, in particular init/main.c

    The Linux kernel documentation, in particular
     Documentation/initrd.txt and Documentation/ramdisk.txt.

    The LILO documentation.

    The LOADLIN documentation



  5.  Other Loopback Root Device Possibilities

  Once the principle of booting a filesystem in a file on a DOS
  partition has been established there are many other things that you
  can now do.



  5.1.  DOS Hard-disk Only Installation

  If it is possible to boot Linux from a file on a DOS harddisk by using
  a boot floppy then it is obviously also possible to do it using the
  harddisk itself.

  A configuration boot menu can be used to give the option of running
  LOADLIN from within the AUTOEXEC.BAT.  This will give a much faster
  boot sequence, but is otherwise identical.



  5.2.  LILO Booted Installation

  Using LOADLIN is only one option for booting a Linux kernel.  There is
  also LILO that does much the same but without needing DOS.

  In this case the DOS format floppy disk can be replaced by an ext2fs
  format one.  Otherwise the details are very similar, with the kernel
  and the initial ramdisk being files on that disk.

  The reason that I chose the LOADLIN method is that the arguments that
  need to be given to LILO are slightly more complex.  Also it is more
  obvious to a casual observer what the floppy disk is since it can be
  read under DOS.



  5.3.  VFAT / NTFS Installation

  I have tried the NTFS method, and have had no problems with it.  The
  NTFS filesystem driver is not a standard kernel option in version
  2.0.x, but is available as a patch from http://www.informatik.hu-
  berlin.de/~loewis/ntfs/.  In version 2.2.x the NTFS driver is included
  as standard in the kernel.

  The only changes for the VFAT or NTFS options are in the initial
  ramdisk, the file /linuxrc needs to mount a file system of type vfat
  or ntfs rather that msdos.

  I know of no reason why this should not also work on a VFAT partition.



  5.4.  Installing Linux without Re-partitioning

  The process of installing Linux on a PC from a standard distribution
  requires booting from a floppy disk and re-partitioning the disk.
  This stage could instead be accomplished by a boot floppy that creates
  an empty loopback device and swap file.  This would allow the
  installation to proceed as normal, but it would install into the
  loopback device rather than a partition.

  This could be used as an alternative to a UMSDOS installation, it
  would be more efficient in disk usage since the minimum allocation
  unit in the ext2 filesystem is 1kB instead of up to 32kB on a DOS
  partition.  It can also be used on VFAT and NTFS formatted disks which
  are otherwise a problem.
  5.5.  Booting From a Non-bootable device

  This method can also be used to boot a Linux system from a device that
  is not normally bootable.



    CD-Rom

    Zip Disks

    Parallel port disk drives

  Obviously there are many other devices that could be used, NFS root
  filesystems are already included in the kernel as an option, but the
  method described here might also be used instead.
