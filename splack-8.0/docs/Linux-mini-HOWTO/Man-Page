   This HOWTO explains what you should bear in mind when you are going to
   write on-line documentation -- a so called man page -- that you want
   to make accessible via the man(1) command. Throughout this HOWTO, a
   manual entry is simply referred to as a man page, regardless of actual
   length and without sexist intention.

   0) A few thoughts on documentation
   
   Why do we write documentation? Silly question. Because we want others
   to be able to use our program, library function or whatever we have
   written and made available. But writing documentation is not all there
   is to it:
     * Documentation must be accessible. If it's hidden in some
       non-standard place where the documentation related tools won't
       find it -- how can it serve its purpose?
     * documentation must be reliable and accurate. There's nothing more
       annoying than having program behaviour and documentation disagree.
       Users will curse you, send you hate mail and throw your work into
       the bit bucket, with the firm intent to never install anything
       written by that jerk again.
       
   The historical and well known way documentation is accessed on UNIX is
   via the man(1) command. This HOWTO describes what you have to do to
   write a man page that will be correctly processed by the documentation
   related tools. The most important of these tools are man(1), xman(1x),
   apropos(1), makewhatis(8) and catman(8). Reliability and accuracy of
   the information are, of course, up to you. But even in this respect
   you will find [18]some ideas below that help you avoid some common
   glitches.
   
   1) How are man pages accessed? 
   
   You need to know the precise mechanism how man pages are accessed in
   order to give your man page the right name and install it in the right
   place. Any man page belongs to a specific section, which is denoted by
   a single character. The most common sections under Linux and their
   human readable names are
Section The human readable name
   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.
   8    System administration tools that only root can execute.
   9    Another (Linux specific) place for kernel routine documentation.
   n    New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate section.
   o    Old documentation, that may be kept for a grace period.
   l    Local documentation referring to this particular system.

   The name of the source file for a man page (the input to the
   formatting system) is the name of the command, function or file name,
   followed by a dot, followed by the section. If you write the
   documentation on the format of the `passwd' file you have to name the
   source file `passwd.5'. Here we also have an example of a file name
   that is the same as a command name. There might be even a library
   subroutine named passwd. Sectioning is the usual way to resolve these
   ambiguities: The command description is found in the file `passwd.1'
   and the hypothetical library subroutine in `passwd.3'.
   Sometimes additional characters are appended and the file name looks
       for example like `xterm.1x' or `wish.1tk'. The intent is to
       indicate that this is documentation for an X Window program or a
       Tk application, respectively. Some manual browsers can make use of
       this additional information. For example xman will use `xterm(x)'
       and `wish(tk)' in the list of available documentation.
       
   Please don't use the n, o and l sections; according to the File System
   Standard these sections are deprecated. Stick to the numeric sections.
   Beware of name clashes with existing programs, functions or file
   names. It is certainly a bad idea to write yet another editor and call
   it ed, sed (for smart ed) or red (for Rocky's ed). By making sure your
   program's name is unique you avoid that someone executes your program
   and reads someone else's man page or vice versa. Checking out the lsm
   database on a program name is a place to start doing so.
   
   Now we know the name to give our file. The next decision is which
   directory it will finally get installed (say, when the user runs `make
   install' for your package.) On Linux, all man pages are below
   directories mentioned in the environment variable MANPATH. The doc
   related tools use it quite similar like the shell uses PATH to locate
   executables. In fact, MANPATH has the same format as PATH. Both hold a
   colon separated list of directories (with the exception that MANPATH
   does not allow empty fields and relative pathnames but has absolute
   names only.) If MANPATH is not set or not exported, a default will be
   used that contains at least the /usr/man directory. To speed up the
   search and to keep directories small, the directories specified by
   MANPATH (the so called base directories) contain a bunch of
   subdirectories named `man<s>' where <s> stands for the one character
   section introduced in the table above. Not all of the sections may be
   represented by a subdirectory because there simply is no reason to
   keep an empty `mano' subdirectory. However, there may be directories
   named `cat<s>', `dvi<s>' and `ps<s>' which hold documentation that is
   ready to display or print. More on this later. The only other file in
   any base directory should be a file named `whatis'. The purpose and
   creation of this file will also be described under paragraph 11). The
   safest way to have a man page for section <s> installed in the right
   place is to put it in the directory /usr/man/man<s>. A good Makefile,
   however, will allow the user to chose a base directory, by means of a
   make variable, MANDIR, say. Most of the GNU packages can be configured
   with the --prefix=/what/ever option. The manuals will then be
   installed under the base directory /what/ever/man. I suggest you also
   provide a way to do something similar.
   
   With the advent of the [19]Linux File System Standard (FS-Stnd),
   things became more complicated. The FS-Stnd 1.2 states that
   "Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/man to support
       manual pages which are written in different (or multiple)
       languages."
       
   This is achieved by introducing another directory level that
   distinguishes between different languages. Quoting again from FS-Stnd
   1.2:
   "This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/man is based on
       Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale
       identification string -- the most well accepted method to describe
       a cultural environment. The <locale> string is:
       <language>[_<territory>][.<character-set>][,<version>]"
       
   (See the FS-Stnd for a few common <locale> strings.) According to
   these guidelines, we have our man pages in
   /usr/man/<locale>/man[1-9lno]. The formatted versions should then be
   in /usr/man/<locale>/cat[1-9lno] of course, otherwise we could only
   provide them for a single locale. HOWEVER, I can not recommend
   switching to that structure at this time. The FS-Stnd 1.2 also allows
   that
   "Systems which use a unique language and code set for all manual pages
       may omit the <locale> substring and store all manual pages in
       <mandir>. For example, systems which only have English manual
       pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages (the man[1-9]
       directories) directly in /usr/man. (That is the traditional
       circumstance and arrangement in fact.)"
       
   I would not switch until all tools (like xman, tkman, info and many
   others that read man pages) can cope with the new structure.
   
   2) How should a formatted man page look like?
   
   Let me present you an example. Below I will explain it in detail. If
   you read this as plain text it won't show the different typefaces
   (bold and italics). Please refer to the paragraph "[20]What are the
   font conventions?" for further explanations. Here comes the man page
   for the (hypothetical) foo program.

NAME
     foo - frobnicate the bar library

SYNOPSIS
     foo [-bar] [-c config-file ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     foo  frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol
     tables. By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges
     them  in  reverse  order  by time for the xyzzy(1) linker to
     find them. The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG
     (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.  All files are processed in the
     order specified.

OPTIONS
     -b   Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.

     -c config-file
          Use the alternate system wide  config-file  instead  of
          /etc/foo.conf.   This overrides any FOOCONF environment
          variable.

     -a   In addition to the baz segments, also parse the  blurfl
          headers.

     -r   Recursive  mode.  Operates  as fast as lightning at the
          expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.

FILES
     /etc/foo.conf
          The system wide configuration file. See foo(5) for fur-
          ther details.
     ~/.foorc
          Per  user  configuration  file.  See foo(5) for further
          details.

ENVIRONMENT
     FOOCONF
          If non-null the full pathname for an  alternate  system
          wide foo.conf.  Overridden by the -c option.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

     Bad magic number.
          The input file does not look like an archive file.
     Old style baz segments.
          foo  can  only  handle  new  style  baz segments. COBOL
          object libraries are not supported in this version.

BUGS
     The command name should have been chosen more  carefully  to
     reflect its purpose.

   Here's the explanation as I promised.
   
   The NAME section
   
   ...is the only required section. Man pages without a name section are
   as useful as refrigerators at the north pole. This section also has a
   standardized format consisting of a comma separated list of program or
   function names followed by a dash followed by a short (usually one
   line) description what functionality the program (function, file) is
   supposed to provide. By means of makewhatis(8) the name sections make
   it into the whatis database files. Makewhatis is the reason why the
   name section must exist and why it must adhere to the format I
   described. In the groff source it must look like
   
   .SH NAME foo \- frobnicate the bar library
   
   The \- is of importance here. The backslash is needed to make the dash
   distinct from a hyphenation dash that may appear in either the command
   name or the one line description.
   
   The SYNOPSIS section
   
   ...is intended to give a short overview on available program options.
   For functions this sections lists corresponding include files and the
   prototype so the programmer knows the type and number of arguments as
   well as the return type.
   
   The DESCRIPTION section 
   
   ...gives an eloquent explanation why your sequence of 0s and 1s is
   worth anything at all. Here's where you write down all your knowledge.
   This is the Hall Of Fame. Win other programmer's and user's admiration
   by making this section the source of reliable and detailed
   information. Explain what the arguments are for, the file format, what
   algorithms do the dirty jobs.
   
   The OPTIONS section
   
   ...gives a description for any option how it affects program
   behaviour. You knew that, didn't you?
   
   The FILES section
   
   ...lists files the program or function uses. For example,
   configuration files, startup files, files the program directly
   operates on. It is a good idea to give the full pathname of these
   files and to make the install process modify the directory part to
   match user preferences: the groff manuals have a default prefix of
   /usr/local, so they reference /usr/local/lib/groff/* by default.
   However, if you install using 'make prefix=/opt/gnu' the references in
   the man page change to /opt/gnu/lib/groff/*
   
   The ENVIRONMENT section 
   
   ...lists all environment variables that affect your program or
   function and tells how, of course. Most commonly the variables will
   hold pathnames, filenames or default options.
   
   The DIAGNOSTICS section
   
   ...should give an overview of the most common error messages from your
   program and how to cope with them. There's no need to explain system
   error error messages (from perror(3)) or fatal signals (from
   psignal(3)) as they can appear during execution of any program.
   
   The BUGS section 
   
   ...should ideally be non-existent. If you're brave, you can describe
   here limitations, known inconveniences, features that others may
   regard as misfeatures. If you're not so brave, rename it the TO DO
   section ;-)
   
   The AUTHOR section
   
   ...is nice to have in case there are gross errors in the documentation
   or program behaviour (Bzzt!) and you want to mail a bug report.
   
   The SEE ALSO section
   
   ...is a list of related man pages in alphabetical order.
   Conventionally, it is the last section. You are free to invent other
   sections if they really don't fit in one of those described so far. So
   how exactly did you generate that man page? I expected that question,
   here's the source, Luke:

   3) How do I document several programs/functions in a single man page?
   
   Many programs (grep, egrep) and functions (printf, fprintf, ...) are
   documented in a single man page. However, these man pages would be
   quite useless if they were only accessible under one name. We can not
   expect a user to remember that the egrep man page is actually the grep
   man page. It is therefore necessary to have the man page available
   under different names. You have several possibilities to achieve this:
    1. have identical copies for each name.
    2. connect all man pages using hard links.
    3. symbolic links pointing to the actual man page.
    4. use groff's `source' mechanism provided by the `.so' macro.
       
   The first way is obviously a waste of disk space. The second is not
   recommended because intelligent versions of the catman program can
   save a lot of work by looking at the the file type or contents. Hard
   links will prevent catman from being clever. (catman's purpose is to
   format all man pages so that they can be displayed more quickly.) The
   third alternative has a slight drawback: if flexibility is a concern,
   you have to be aware that there are file systems that do not support
   symbolic links. The upshot of this is that the Best Thing (TM) is
   using groff's source mechanism. Here's how to do it: If you want to
   have your man page available under the names `foo' and `bar' in
   section 1, then put the man page in foo.1 and have bar.1 look like
   this:
   
   .so man1/foo.1
   
   It is important to specify the `man1/' directory part as well as the
   file name `foo.1' because when groff is run by the browser it will
   have the manual base directory as its current working directory (cwd)
   and groff interprets .so arguments relative to the cwd.
   
   4) Which macro package should I use? 
   
   There are a number of macro packages especially designed for use in
   writing man pages. Usually they are in the groff macro directory
   /usr/lib/groff/tmac. The file names are tmac.<something>, where
   <something> is the argument to groff's -m option. Groff will use
   tmac.<something> when it is given the `-m <something>' option. Often
   the blank between `-m' and `<something>' is omitted so we may say
   `groff -man' when we are formatting man pages using the tmac.an macro
   package. That's the reason for the strange name `tmac.an'. Besides
   tmac.an there is another popular macro package, tmac.doc, which
   originated at the University of California at Berkeley. Many BSD man
   pages use it and it seems that UCB has made it its standard for
   documentation. The tmac.doc macros are much more flexible but alas,
   there are manual browsers that will not use them but always call groff
   -man. For example, all xman programs I have seen will screw up on man
   pages requiring tmac.doc. So do yourself a favor: use tmac.an -- use
   of any other macro package is considered harmful. tmac.andoc is a
   pseudo macro package that takes a look at the source and then loads
   either tmac.an or tmac.doc. Actually any man page browser should use
   it but until now not all of them do, so it is best we cling to ye olde
   tmac.an. Anything I tell you from now on and concerning macros only
   holds true for tmac.an. If you want to use the tmac.doc macros anyway,
   here is a pointer to detailed information on how to use them:
   [22]http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man There is a searchable index form on
   the page. Enter mdoc.samples and it will find you mdoc.samples(7), a
   tutorial sampler for writing BSD man pages.
   The definitive dope for troff, with all macros explained, is the
   [23]Troff User's Manual by Jospeh F. Ossanna and Brian W. Kernighan,
   revised November 1992. AT&T Bell Labs have made it publicly available.
   It's a 92k gzipped PostScript file. Don't forget to check out [24]W.
   Richard Steven's homepage (famous for Unix Network Programming as well
   as the TCP/IP Illustrated trilogy), who also has a list of [25]Troff
   Resources including tbl, eqn, pic and other filters.
   
   5) What preprocessors may I use? 
   
   Groff comes with at least three preprocessors, tbl, eqn, and pic (on
   some systems they are named gtbl, geqn and gpic.) Their purpose is to
   translate preprocessor macros and their data to regular troff input.
   Tbl is a table preprocessor, eqn is an equations/maths preprocessor
   and pic is a picture preprocessor. Please refer to the man pages for
   more information on what functionality they provide. To put it in a
   nutshell: don't write man pages requiring ANY preprocessor. Eqn will
   generally produce terrible output for typewriter-like devices,
   unfortunately the type of device 99% of all man pages are viewed on.
   For example, XAllocColor.3x uses a few formulas with exponentiation.
   Due to the nature of typewriter-like devices the exponent will be on
   the same line as the base. N to the power of two appears as `N2'. Tbl
   should be avoided because all xman programs I have seen fail on them.
   Xman 3.1.6 uses the following command to format man pages, e.g.
   signal(7):
   
   gtbl /usr/man/man7/signal.7 | geqn | gtbl | groff -Tascii -man
   /tmp/xmana01760 2> /dev/null
   
   which screws up for sources using gtbl, because gtbl output is fed
   again into gtbl. The effect is a man page without your table. I don't
   know if it's a bug or a feature that gtbl chokes on its own output or
   if xman could be a little smarter not using gtbl twice... Anyway, if
   you want a table, format it yourself and put it between .nf .fi lines
   so that it will be left unformatted. You won't have bold and italics
   this way but this beats having your table swallowed any day. I have
   yet to see a man page requiring pic preprocessing. But I would not
   like it. As you can see above, xman will not use it and groff will
   certainly do the funky wadakiki on the input.
   
   6) Should I distribute source and/or already formatted documentation? 
   
   Let me give the pros (+) and cons (-) of a few selected possibilities:
    1. Source only:
       + smaller distribution package.
       - inaccessible on systems without groff.
    2. Uncompressed formatted only:
       + accessible even on systems without groff.
       - the user can't generate a dvi or postscript file.
       - waste of disk space on systems that also handle compressed
       pages.
    3. Compressed formatted only:
       + accessible even on systems without groff.
       - the user can't generate a dvi or postscript file.
       - which compression format would you use? .Z? .z? .gz? All of
       them?
    4. Source and uncompressed formatted:
       + accessible even on systems without groff.
       - larger distribution package
       - some systems may expect compressed formatted man pages.
       - redundant information on systems equipped with groff.
       
   IMHO it is best to distribute source only. The argument that it's
   inaccessible on systems without groff does not matter. The 500+ man
   pages of the Linux Documentation Project are source only. The man
   pages of XFree86 are source only. The man pages from the FSF are
   source only. In fact, I have rarely seen software distributed with
   formatted man pages. If any sysadmin is really concerned about having
   man pages accessible then he also has groff installed.
   
   7) What are the font conventions? 
   
   First of all: don't use direct font operators like \fB \fP etc. Use
   macros which take arguments. This way you avoid a common glitch:
   forgetting the font change at the end of the word and having the bold
   or italic extend up to the next font change. Believe me, it happens
   more often than you think. The tmac.an macros provide the following
   type faces:
   .B Bold
       .BI Bold alternating with italics
       .BR Bold alternating with Roman
       .I Italics
       .IB Italics alternating with bold
       .IR Italics alternating with Roman
       .RB Roman alternating with bold
       .RI Roman alternating with italics
       .SM Small (scaled 9/10 of the regular size)
       .SB Small bold (NOT small alternating with bold)
       
   X alternating with Y means that the odd arguments are typeset in X
   while the even arguments are typeset in Y. For example
   .BI "Arg 1 is Bold, " "Arg 2 is Italics, " "and Bold, " "and Italics."
       
   The double quotes are needed to include white space into an argument;
   without them, no white space appears between the alternating
   typefaces. In fact, you'll only need the macros for alternating
   typefaces in cases where you want to avoid white space between
   typeface changes. So much for what's available. Here's how you should
   make use of the different typefaces: (portions shamelessly stolen from
   man(7))
   
   Although there are many arbitrary conventions for man pages in the
   UNIX world, the existence of several hundred Linux-specific man pages
   defines our standards: For functions, the arguments are always
   specified using italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest
   of the function is specified in bold:
   .BI "myfunction(int " argc ", char **" argv );
       
   Filenames are always in italics, except in the SYNOPSIS section, where
   included files are in bold. So you should use
   .I /usr/include/stdio.h
       
   and
   .B #include <stdio.h>
       
   Special macros, which are usually in upper case, are in bold:
   .B MAXINT
       
   When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold. This
   list usually uses the .TP (paragraph with hanging tag) macro as
   follows:
   .TP
       .B EBADF
       .I fd is not a valid file descriptor.
       .TP
       .B EINVAL
       .I fd is unsuitable for reading
       
   Any reference to another man page (or to the subject of the current
   man page) is in bold. If the manual section number is given, it is
   given in roman, without any spaces:
   .BR man (7)
       
   Acronyms look best when typeset in small type face. So I recommend
   .SM UNIX
       .SM ASCII
       .SM TAB
       .SM NFS
       .SM LALR(1)
       
   8) Polishing your man page
   
   Following are some guidelines that increase reliability, readability
   and 'formatability' of your documentation.
     * Test examples if they work (use cut and paste to give your shell
       the exact wording from the man page) read output of your command
       into your man page, don't type what you THINK your program will
       print.
     * Proof read, ispell, have someone else read it, especially if you
       are not a native English speaker. The HOWTO you are reading by now
       has not yet passed the latter test. Do you want to volunteer?
     * Test your man page: Does groff complain when you format your man
       page? It's nice to have the groff command line in a comment. Does
       the man(1) command complain when you call `man yourprog'? Does the
       way how man(1) uses the formatting system produce the expected
       result? Will xman(1x) and tkman(1tk) cope with your manual?
       XFree86 3.1 has xman 3.1.6 - X11R6, it will try to uncompress
       using
       gzip -c -d < %s > %s
       zcat < %s > %s
     * Will makewhatis(8) be able to extract the one-line description
       from the NAME section?
       
   9) How do I get a plain text man page without all that ^H^_ stuff? 
   
   Have a look at col(1), col can filter out backspace sequences. Just in
   case you can't wait that long:
   
   funnyprompt$ groff -t -e -mandoc -Tascii manpage.1 | col -bx >
   manpage.txt
   
   The -t and -e switches tell groff to preprocess using tbl and eqn.
   This is overkill for man pages that don't require preprocessing but it
   doesn't harm apart from a few CPU cycles wasted. On the other hand,
   not using -t when it is actually required does harm: the table is
   terribly formatted. You can even find out (well, "guess" is a better
   word) what command is needed to format a certain groff document (not
   just man pages) by issuing
   
   funnyprompt$ grog /usr/man/man7/signal.7 groff -t -man
   /usr/man/man7/signal.7
   
   "Grog" stands for "GROff Guess", and it does what it says--guess, if
   it were perfect we wouldn't need options any more. I've seen it guess
   wrong on macro packages, but never on preprocessors. Here is a little
   perl script I wrote that can delete the page headers and footers,
   therefore saving you a few pages when printing long and elaborate man
   pages. Save it in a file named strip-headers & chmod 755.
    #!/usr/bin/perl -wn
    #  make it slurp the whole file at once:
    undef $/;
    #  delete first header:
    s/^\n*.*\n+//;
    #  delete last footer:
    s/\n+.*\n+$/\n/g;
    #  delete page breaks:
    s/\n\n+[^ \t].*\n\n+(\S+).*\1\n\n+/\n/g;
    #  collapse two or more blank lines into a single one:
    s/\n{3,}/\n\n/g;
    #  see what's left...
    print;

   You have to use it as the first filter after the 'man' command as it
   relies on the number of newlines being output by groff. For example:
   
   funnyprompt$ man bash | strip-headers | col -bx > bash.txt
   
   10) How do I get a high quality PostScript man page? 
   
   funnyprompt$ groff -t -e -mandoc -Tps manpage.1 > manpage.ps
   
   Print that using your favorite PostScript printer/interpreter. See
   [26]question 9) for explanation of options.
   
   11) How do I get `apropos' and `whatis' to work? 
   
   Suppose you wonder what compilers are installed on your system and how
   these can be invoked. To answer this (frequently asked) question you
   say
   
   funnyprompt$ apropos compiler
   f77 (1) - Fortran 77 compiler
   gcc (1) - GNU C and C++ compiler
   pc (1) - Pascal compiler
   
   Apropos and whatis are used to give a quick response which man page
   has information on a certain topic. Both programs search a number of
   files named `whatis' that may be found in each of the manual base
   directories. Like I said before, the whatis data base files contain a
   one line entry for any man page in the respective directory tree. In
   fact, that line is exactly the NAME section (to be precise: joined on
   one line and with hyphenation removed, also note that the section is
   mentioned within parentheses). The whatis data base files are created
   with the makewhatis(8) program. There are several versions around, so
   please refer to the man page what options are available. In order for
   makewhatis to be able to extract the NAME sections correctly it is
   important that you, the manual writer, adhere to the NAME section
   format described under [27]question 2). The difference between apropos
   and whatis is where in the line and what they are looking for. Apropos
   (which is equivalent to man -k) searches the argument string anywhere
   on the line whereas whatis (equivalent to man -f) tries to match a
   complete command name only on the part before the dash. Consequently,
   `whatis cc' will report if there is a cc manual and remain quiet for
   gcc.
   
                    Corrections and suggestions welcome!
