  1.2.  Credits and request for help.

  I want to thank Arnt Gulbrandsen whom I cause to suffer through the
  drafts to this work and who provided many useful suggestions.  I also
  want to thank the numerous people that have e-mailed suggestions and
  notes.


  This will never be a finished document; please send me mail about your
  problems and successes.  You can help make this a better HOWTO.  So
  please send comments and/or questions or money to janl@linpro.no.  Or
  buy my DNS book.  See the bibliography for information about that.  If
  you send e-mail and want an answer please show the simple courtesy of
  making sure that the return address is correct and working.  Also,
  please read the ``qanda'' section before mailing me.  Another thing, I
  can only understand Norwegian and English.


  This is a HOWTO.  I have maintained it as part of the LDP since 1995.
  I have, during 2000, written a book on the same subject.  I want to
  say that, though this HOWTO is in many ways much like the book it is
  not a watered down version concocted to market the book.  You will
  however find the book in the bibliography at the end of this HOWTO.
  The readers of this HOWTO have helped me understand what is difficult
  to understand about DNS.  This has helped the book, but the book has
  also helped me to think more about what this HOWTO needs.  The HOWTO
  begot the book.  The book begot version 3 of this HOWTO.  My thanks to
  the book publisher, Que, that took a chance on me :-)



  1.3.  Dedication

  This HOWTO is dedicated to Anne Line Norheim Langfeldt.  Though she
  will probably never read it since she's not that kind of girl.


  2.  Introduction.

  What this is and isn't.


  DNS is the Domain Name System.  DNS converts machine names to the IP
  addresses that all machines on the net have.  It translates (or "maps"
  as the jargon would have it) from name to address and from address to
  name, and some other things.  This HOWTO documents how to define such
  mappings using Unix system, with a few things specific to Linux.



  A mapping is simply an association between two things, in this case a
  machine name, like ftp.linux.org, and the machine's IP number (or
  address) 199.249.150.4.  DNS also contains mappings the other way,
  from the IP number to the machine name; this is called a "reverse
  mapping".


  DNS is, to the uninitiated (you ;-), one of the more opaque areas of
  network administration.  Fortunately DNS isn't really that hard.  This
  HOWTO will try to make a few things clearer.  It describes how to set
  up a simple DNS name server, starting with a caching only server and
  going on to setting up a primary DNS server for a domain.  For more
  complex setups you can check the ``qanda'' section of this document.
  If it's not described there you will need to read the Real
  Documentation.  I'll get back to what this Real Documentation consists
  of in ``the last chapter''.


  Before you start on this you should configure your machine so that you
  can telnet in and out of it, and successfully make all kinds of
  connections to the net, and you should especially be able to do telnet
  127.0.0.1 and get your own machine (test it now!).  You also need good
  /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts files as a
  starting point, since I will not explain their function here.  If you
  don't already have all this set up and working the Networking-HOWTO
  and/or the Networking-Overview-HOWTO explains how to set it up.  Read
  them.


  When I say `your machine' I mean the machine you are trying to set up
  DNS on, not any other machine you might have that's involved in your
  networking effort.


  I assume you're not behind any kind of firewall that blocks name
  queries.  If you are you will need a special configuration --- see the
  section on ``qanda''.


  Name serving on Unix is done by a program called named.  This is a
  part of the ``BIND'' package which is coordinated by The Internet
  Software Consortium.  Named is included in most Linux distributions
  and is usually installed as /usr/sbin/named, usually from a package
  called BIND.


  If you have a named you can probably use it; if you don't have one you
  can get a binary off a Linux ftp site, or get the latest and greatest
  source from  <ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/>.  This HOWTO is about
  BIND version 8.  The old version of the HOWTO, about BIND 4, is still
  available at  <http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/DNS/> in case you use BIND
  4.  If the named man page talks about (at the very end, in the FILES
  section) named.conf you have BIND 8; if it talks about named.boot you
  have BIND 4.  If you have 4 and are security conscious you really
  ought to upgrade to the latest version of BIND 8.  Now.


  DNS is a net-wide database.  Take care about what you put into it.  If
  you put junk into it, you, and others, will get junk out of it.  Keep
  your DNS tidy and consistent and you will get good service from it.
  Learn to use it, admin it, debug it and you will be another good admin
  keeping the net from falling to its knees by mismanagement.


  Tip: Make backup copies of all the files I instruct you to change if
  you already have them, so that if after going through this nothing
  works you can get it back to your old, working state.


  3.  A resolving, caching name server.

  A first stab at DNS config, very useful for dialup, cable-modem and
  ADSL users.


  On Red Hat and Red Hat related distributions you can achieve the same
  practical result as this HOWTO's first section by installing the
  packages bind, bind-utils and caching-nameserver.  If you use Debian
  simply install bind and bind-doc.  Of course just installing those
  packages won't teach you as much as reading this HOWTO.  So install
  the packages, and then read along verifying the files they installed.


  A caching only name server will find the answer to name queries and
  remember the answer the next time you need it.  This will shorten the
  waiting time the next time significantly, especially if you're on a
  slow connection.


  First you need a file called /etc/named.conf (Debian:
  /etc/bind/named.conf).  This is read when named starts.  For now it
  should simply contain:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  // Config file for caching only name server

  options {
          directory "/var/named";

          // Uncommenting this might help if you have to go through a
          // firewall and things are not working out.  But you probably
          // need to talk to your firewall admin.

          // query-source port 53;
  };

  zone "." {
          type hint;
          file "root.hints";
  };

  zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
          type master;
          file "pz/127.0.0";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The Linux distribution packages may use different file names for each
  kind of file mentioned here; they will still contain about the same
  things.


  The `directory' line tells named where to look for files.  All files
  named subsequently will be relative to this.  Thus pz is a directory
  under /var/named, i.e., /var/named/pz.  /var/named is the right
  directory according to the Linux File system Standard.


  The file named /var/named/root.hints is named in this.
  /var/named/root.hints should contain this: (If you cut and paste this
  file from an electronic version of this document, please note that
  there should be no leading spaces in the file, i.e. all the lines
  should start with a non-blank character.  Some document processing
  software will insert spaces at beginning of the lines, causing some
  confusion.  In that case please remove the leading spaces)

  The file describes the root name servers in the world.  The servers
  change over time and must be maintained now and then.  See the
  ``maintenance section'' for how to keep it up to date.


  The next section in named.conf is the last zone. I will explain its
  use in a later chapter; for now just make this a file named 127.0.0 in
  the subdirectory pz: (Again, please remove leading spaces if you cut
  and paste this)



  ______________________________________________________________________
  $TTL 3D
  @               IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
                                  1       ; Serial
                                  8H      ; Refresh
                                  2H      ; Retry
                                  4W      ; Expire
                                  1D)     ; Minimum TTL
                          NS      ns.linux.bogus.
  1                       PTR     localhost.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Next, you need a /etc/resolv.conf looking something like this: (Again:
  Remove spaces!)


  ______________________________________________________________________
  search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu
  nameserver 127.0.0.1
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The `search' line specifies what domains should be searched for any
  host names you want to connect to.  The `nameserver' line specifies
  the address of your nameserver, in this case your own machine since
  that is where your named runs (127.0.0.1 is right, no matter if your
  machine has another address too).  If you want to list several name
  servers put in one `nameserver' line for each. (Note: Named never
  reads this file, the resolver that uses named does. Note 2: In some
  resolv.conf files you find a line saying "domain".  That's fine, but
  don't use both "search" and "domain", only one of them will work).


  To illustrate what this file does: If a client tries to look up foo,
  then foo.subdomain.your-domain.edu is tried first, then foo.your-
  domain.edu, and finally foo.  You may not want to put in too many
  domains in the search line, as it takes time to search them all.


  The example assumes you belong in the domain subdomain.your-
  domain.edu; your machine, then, is probably called your-
  machine.subdomain.your-domain.edu.  The search line should not contain
  your TLD (Top Level Domain, `edu' in this case).  If you frequently
  need to connect to hosts in another domain you can add that domain to
  the search line like this: (Remember to remove the leading spaces, if
  any)


  ______________________________________________________________________
  search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu other-domain.com
  ______________________________________________________________________



  and so on. Obviously you need to put real domain names in instead.
  Please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain names.  This
  is important; please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain
  names.



  3.1.  Starting named

  After all this it's time to start named.  If you're using a dialup
  connection connect first.  Type `ndc start', and press return, no
  options.  If that does not work try `/usr/sbin/ndc start' instead.  If
  that back-fires see the ``qanda'' section.  If you view your syslog
  message file (usually called /var/adm/messages, but another directory
  to look in is /var/log and another file to look in is syslog) while
  starting named (do tail -f /var/log/messages) you should see something
  like:


  (the lines ending in \ continues on the next line)



       Dec 15 23:53:29 localhost named[3768]: starting.  named 8.2.2-P7 \

  If there are any messages about errors then there is a mistake.  Named
  will name the file it is in.  Go back and check the file.  Run "ndc
  restart" when you have fixed it.


  Now you can test your setup.  Traditionally a program called nslookup
  is used for this.  These days dig is recommended:



  $ dig -x 127.0.0.1

  ; <<>> DiG 8.2 <<>> -x
  ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
  ;; got answer:
  ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4
  ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0
  ;; QUERY SECTION:

  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.  1D IN PTR  localhost.

  ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
  0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   1D IN NS        ns.penguin.bv.

  ;; Total query time: 30 msec
  ;; FROM: lookfar to SERVER: default -- 127.0.0.1
  ;; WHEN: Sat Dec 16 00:16:12 2000
  ;; MSG SIZE  sent: 40  rcvd: 110



  If that's what you get it's working.  We hope.  Anything else, go back
  and check everything.  Each time you change the named.conf file you
  need to restart named using the ndc restart command.


  Now you can enter a query.  Try looking up some machine close to you.
  pat.uio.no is close to me, at the University of Oslo:



       $ dig pat.uio.no

       ; <<>> DiG 8.2 <<>> pat.uio.no
       ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
       ;; got answer:

       ;; MSG SIZE  sent: 28  rcvd: 162



  This time dig asked your named to look for the machine pat.uio.no.  It
  then contacted one of the name server machines named in your
  root.hints file, and asked its way from there.  It might take tiny
  while before you get the result as it may need to search all the
  domains you named in /etc/resolv.conf.  Please note the "aa" on the
  "flags:" line.  It means that the answer is authoritative, that it is
  fresh from an authoritative server.  I'll explain "authoritative"
  later.


  If you ask the same again you get this:

  Note the lack of a "aa" flag in this answer. That means that named did
  not go out on the network to ask this time, as the information is in
  the cache now.  But the cached information might be out of date
  (stale).  So you are informed of this (very slight) possibility by the
  "aa" not being there.  But, now you know that your cache is working.


  3.2.  Resolvers

  All OSes implementing the standard C API has the calls gethostbyname
  and gethostbyaddr.  These can get information from several different
  sources.  Which sources it gets it from is configured in
  /etc/nsswitch.conf on Linux (and some other Unixes).  This is a long
  file specifying from which file or database to get different kinds of
  data types.  It usually contains helpful comments at the top, which
  you should consider reading.  After that find the line starting with
  `hosts:'; it should read:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  hosts:      files dns
  ______________________________________________________________________



  (You remembered about the leading spaces, right? I won't mention them
  again.)


  If there is no line starting with `hosts:' then put in the one above.
  It says that programs should first look in the /etc/hosts file, then
  check DNS according to resolv.conf.



  3.3.  Congratulations

  Now you know how to set up a caching named.  Take a beer, milk, or
  whatever you prefer to celebrate it.



  4.  Forwarding

  In large, well organized, academic or ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  networks you will sometimes find that the network people have set up a
  forwarder hierarchy of DNS servers which helps lighten the internal
  network load and the load on the outside servers as well.  It's not
  easy to know if you're inside such a network or not.  It is however
  not important and by using the DNS server of your network provider as
  a ``forwarder'' you can make the responses to queries faster and less
  of a load on your network.  If you use a modem this can be quite a
  win.  For the sake of this example we assume that your network
  provider has two name servers they want you to use, with IP numbers
  10.0.0.1 and 10.1.0.1.  Then, in your named.conf file, inside the
  opening section called ``options'', insert these lines:


  ______________________________________________________________________
             forward first;
             forwarders {
                  10.0.0.1;
                  10.1.0.1;
              };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  There is also a nice trick for dialup machines using forwarders, it is
  described in the ``qanda'' section.


  Restart your nameserver and test it with dig.  Should work fine.


  5.  A simple  domain.

  How to set up your own domain.


  5.1.  But first some dry theory

  First of all: you read all the stuff before here right? You have to.

  Before we really start this section I'm going to serve you some theory
  on and an example of how DNS works.  And you're going to read it
  because it's good for you.  If you don't want to you should at least
  skim it very quickly.  Stop skimming when you get to what should go in
  your named.conf file.


  DNS is a hierarchical, tree structured, system.  The top is written
  `.' and pronounced `root', as is usual for tree data-structures.
  Under . there are a number of Top Level Domains (TLDs); the best known
  ones are ORG, COM, EDU and NET, but there are many more.  Just like a
  tree it has a root and it branches out.  If you have any computer
  science background you will recognize DNS as a search tree, and you
  will be able to find nodes, leaf nodes and edges.  The dots are nodes,
  the edges are on the names.


  When looking for a machine the query proceeds recursively into the
  hierarchy starting at the root.  If you want to find the address of
  prep.ai.mit.edu., your nameserver has to start asking somewhere.  It
  starts by looking it its cache.  If it knows the answer, having cached
  it before, it will answer right away as we saw in the last section.
  If it does not know it will remove parts from the name starting at the
  left, checking if it knows anything about ai.mit.edu., then mit.edu.,
  then edu. and if not that it does know about . because that was in the
  hints file.  It will then ask a . server about prep.ai.mit.edu. This .
  server will not know the answer, but it will help your server on its
  way by giving a referral, telling it where to look instead.  These
  referrals will eventually lead your server to a nameserver that knows
  the answer.  I will illustrate that now.  +norec means that dig is
  asking non-recursive questions so that we get to do the recursion
  ourselves.  The other options are to reduce the amount of dig produces
  so this won't go on for too many pages:



  $ dig +norec +noH +noques +nostats +nocmd prep.ai.mit.edu.

  This time we got a "ANSWER SECTION", and an answer for our question.
  The "AUTHORITY SECTION" contains information about which servers to
  ask about ai.mit.edu the next time.  So you can ask them directly the
  next time you wonder about ai.mit.edu names.


  So starting at . we found the successive name servers for each level
  in the domain name by referral.  If you had used your own DNS server
  instead of using all those other servers, your named would of-course
  cache all the information it found while digging this out for you, and
  it would not have to ask again for a while.


  In the tree analogue each ``.'' in the name is a branching point.  And
  each part between the ``.''s are the names of individual branches in
  the tree.  One climbs the tree by taking the name we want
  (prep.ai.mit.edu) asking the root (.) or whatever servers father from
  the root toward prep.ai.mit.edu we have information about in the
  cache.  Once the cache limits are reached the recursive resolver goes
  out asking servers, pursuing referrals (edges) further into the name.


  A much less talked about, but just as important domain is in-
  addr.arpa.  It too is nested like the `normal' domains.  in-addr.arpa
  allows us to get the host's name when we have its address.  A
  important thing to note here is that the IP addresses are written in
  reverse order in the in-addr.arpa domain.  If you have the address of
  a machine: 192.148.52.43 named proceeds just like for the
  prep.ai.mit.edu example: find arpa. servers.  Find in-addr.arpa.
  servers, find 192.in-addr.arpa. servers, find 148.192.in-addr.arpa.
  servers, find 52.148.192.in-addr.arpa.  servers.  Find needed records
  for 43.52.148.192.in-addr.arpa.  Clever huh? (Say `yes'.)  The
  reversion of the numbers can be confusing for years though.


  5.2.  Our own domain

  Now to define our own domain.  We're going to make the domain
  linux.bogus and define machines in it.  I use a totally bogus domain
  name to make sure we disturb no-one Out There.


  One more thing before we start: Not all characters are allowed in host
  names.  We're restricted to the characters of the English alphabet: a-
  z, and numbers 0-9 and the character '-' (dash).  Keep to those
  characters.  Upper and lower-case characters are the same for DNS, so
  pat.uio.no is identical to Pat.UiO.No.


  We've already started this part with this line in named.conf:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
          type master;
          file "pz/127.0.0";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Please note the lack of `.' at the end of the domain names in this
  file.  This says that now we will define the zone 0.0.127.in-
  addr.arpa, that we're the master server for it and that it is stored
  in a file called pz/127.0.0.  We've already set up this file, it
  reads:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  $TTL 3D
  @               IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
                                  1       ; Serial
                                  8H      ; Refresh
                                  2H      ; Retry
                                  4W      ; Expire
                                  1D)     ; Minimum TTL
                          NS      ns.linux.bogus.
  1                       PTR     localhost.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Please note the `.' at the end of all the full domain names in this
  file, in contrast to the named.conf file above. Some people like to
  start each zone file with a $ORIGIN directive, but this is
  superfluous.  The origin (where in the DNS hierarchy it belongs) of a
  zone file is specified in the zone section of the named.conf file; in
  this case it's 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.


  This `zone file' contains 3 `resource records' (RRs): A SOA RR.  A NS
  RR and a PTR RR.  SOA is short for Start Of Authority.  The `@' is a
  special notation meaning the origin, and since the `domain' column for
  this file says 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa the first line really means



       0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   IN      SOA ...



  NS is the Name Server RR.  There is no '@' at the start of this line;
  it is implicit since the previous line started with a '@'.  Saves some
  typing that.  So the NS line could also be written
       0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   IN      NS      ns.linux.bogus



  It tells DNS what machine is the name server of the domain 0.0.127.in-
  addr.arpa, it is ns.linux.bogus.  'ns' is a customary name for name-
  servers, but as with web servers who are customarily named
  www.something the name may be anything.


  And finally the PTR (Domain Name Pointer) record says that the host at
  address 1 in the subnet 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa, i.e., 127.0.0.1 is named
  localhost.


  The SOA record is the preamble to all zone files, and there should be
  exactly one in each zone file.  It describes the zone, where it comes
  from (a machine called ns.linux.bogus), who is responsible for its
  contents (hostmaster@linux.bogus; you should insert your e-mail
  address here), what version of the zone file this is (serial: 1), and
  other things having to do with caching and secondary DNS servers.  For
  the rest of the fields (refresh, retry, expire and minimum) use the
  numbers used in this HOWTO and you should be safe.  Before the SOA
  comes a mandatory line, the $TTL 3D line.  Put it in all your zone
  files.


  Now restart your named (the command is ndc restart) and use dig to
  examine your handy work.  -x asks for the inverse query:



       $ dig -x 127.0.0.1

       ; <<>> DiG 8.2 <<>> -x
       ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
       ;; got answer:
       ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4
       ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0
       ;; QUERY SECTION:
       ;;      1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa, type = ANY, class = IN

       ;; ANSWER SECTION:
       1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.  1D IN PTR  localhost.

       ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
       0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   1D IN NS        ns.penguin.bv.

       ;; Total query time: 5 msec
       ;; FROM: lookfar to SERVER: default -- 127.0.0.1
       ;; WHEN: Sat Dec 16 01:13:48 2000
       ;; MSG SIZE  sent: 40  rcvd: 110



  So it manages to get localhost from 127.0.0.1, good.  Now for our main
  task, the linux.bogus domain, insert a new 'zone' section in
  named.conf:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  zone "linux.bogus" {
          notify no;
          type master;
          file "pz/linux.bogus";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Note again the lack of ending `.' on the domain name in the named.conf
  file.


  In the linux.bogus zone file we'll put some totally bogus data:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  ;
  ; Zone file for linux.bogus
  ;
  ; The full zone file
  ;
  $TTL 3D
  @       IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
                          199802151       ; serial, todays date + todays serial #

                          2H              ; retry, seconds
                          4W              ; expire, seconds
                          1D )            ; minimum, seconds
  ;
                  NS      ns              ; Inet Address of name server

                  MX      20 mail.friend.bogus.   ; Secondary Mail Exchanger

  ns              A       192.168.196.2
  mail            A       192.168.196.4
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Two things must be noted about the SOA record.  ns.linux.bogus must be
  a actual machine with a A record.  It is not legal to have a CNAME
  record for the machine mentioned in the SOA record.  Its name need not
  be `ns', it could be any legal host name.  Next,
  hostmaster.linux.bogus should be read as hostmaster@linux.bogus.  This
  should be a mail alias, or a mailbox, where the person(s) maintaining
  DNS should read mail frequently.  Any mail regarding the domain will
  be sent to the address listed here.  The name need not be
  `hostmaster', it can be your normal e-mail address, but the e-mail
  address `hostmaster' is often expected to work as well.


  There is one new RR type in this file, the MX, or Mail eXchanger RR.
  It tells mail systems where to send mail that is addressed to
  someone@linux.bogus, namely to mail.linux.bogus or mail.friend.bogus.
  The number before each machine name is that MX RR's priority.  The RR
  with the lowest number (10) is the one mail should be sent to if
  possible.  If that fails the mail can be sent to one with a higher
  number, a secondary mail handler, i.e., mail.friend.bogus which has
  priority 20 here.


  Restart named by running ndc restart.  Examine the results with dig:

  Upon careful examination you will discover a bug.  The line



       linux.bogus.            3D IN MX        10 mail.linux.bogus.linux.bogus.



  is all wrong.  It should be



       linux.bogus.            3D IN MX        10 mail.linux.bogus.



  I deliberately made a mistake so you could learn from it :-) Looking
  in the zone file we find this line:



                       MX      10 mail.linux.bogus     ; Primary Mail Exchanger



  It is missing a period.  Or has a 'linux.bogus' too many.  If a
  machine name does not end in a period in a zone file the origin is
  added to its end causing the double linux.bogus.linux.bogus.  So
  either



  ______________________________________________________________________
                  MX      10 mail.linux.bogus.    ; Primary Mail Exchanger
  ______________________________________________________________________



  or


  ______________________________________________________________________
                  MX      10 mail                 ; Primary Mail Exchanger
  ______________________________________________________________________



  is correct.  I prefer the latter form, it's less to type.  There are
  some BIND experts that disagree, and some that agree with this.  In a
  zone file the domain should either be written out and ended with a `.'
  or it should not be included at all, in which case it defaults to the
  origin.


  I must stress that in the named.conf file there should not be `.'s
  after the domain names.  You have no idea how many times a `.' too
  many or few have fouled up things and confused the h*ll out of people.


  So having made my point here is the new zone file, with some extra
  information in it as well:

  There are a number of new RRs here: HINFO (Host INFOrmation) has two
  parts; it's a good habit to quote each.  The first part is the
  hardware or CPU on the machine, and the second part the software or OS
  on the machine.  The machine called 'ns' has a Pentium CPU and runs
  Linux 2.0.  CNAME (Canonical NAME) is a way to give each machine
  several names.  So www is an alias for ns.


  CNAME record usage is a bit controversial. But it's safe to follow the
  rule that a MX, CNAME or SOA record should never refer to a CNAME
  record, they should only refer to something with an A record, so it is
  inadvisable to have


  ______________________________________________________________________
  foobar          CNAME   www                     ; NO!
  ______________________________________________________________________



  but correct to have


  ______________________________________________________________________
  foobar          CNAME   ns                      ; Yes!
  ______________________________________________________________________



  It's also safe to assume that a CNAME is not a legal host name for an
  e-mail address: webmaster@www.linux.bogus is an illegal e-mail address
  given the setup above.  You can expect quite a few mail admins Out
  There to enforce this rule even if it works for you.  The way to avoid
  this is to use A records (and perhaps some others too, like a MX
  record) instead:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  www             A       192.168.196.2
  ______________________________________________________________________



  A number of the arch-BIND-wizards, recommend not using CNAME at all.
  But the discussion of why or why not is beyond the scope of this
  HOWTO.


  But as you see, this HOWTO and many sites do not follow this rule.


  Load the new database by running ndc reload, which causes named to
  read its files again.

  That's good.  As you see it looks a lot like the zone file itself.
  Let's check what it says for www alone:



  $ dig www.linux.bogus +pfmin
  ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
  ;; got answer:
  ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 27345
  ;; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 1
  ;; QUERY SECTION:
  ;;      www.linux.bogus, type = A, class = IN

  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  www.linux.bogus.        3D IN CNAME     ns.linux.bogus.
  ns.linux.bogus.         3D IN A         192.168.196.2



  In other words, the real name of www.linux.bogus is ns.linux.bogus,
  and it gives you some of the information it has about ns as well,
  enough to connect to it if you were a program.


  Now we're halfway.


  5.3.  The reverse zone

  Now programs can convert the names in linux.bogus to addresses which
  they can connect to. But also required is a reverse zone, one making
  DNS able to convert from an address to a name. This name is used by a
  lot of servers of different kinds (FTP, IRC, WWW and others) to decide
  if they want to talk to you or not, and if so, maybe even how much
  priority you should be given. For full access to all services on the
  Internet a reverse zone is required.


  Put this in named.conf:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  zone "196.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
          notify no;
          type master;
          file "pz/192.168.196";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  This is exactly as with the 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa, and the contents are
  similar:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  $TTL 3D
  @       IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
                          199802151 ; Serial, todays date + todays serial
                          8H      ; Refresh
                          2H      ; Retry
                          4W      ; Expire
                          1D)     ; Minimum TTL
                  NS      ns.linux.bogus.

  1               PTR     gw.linux.bogus.
  2               PTR     ns.linux.bogus.
  3               PTR     donald.linux.bogus.
  4               PTR     mail.linux.bogus.
  5               PTR     ftp.linux.bogus.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Now you restart your named (ndc restart) and examine your work with
  dig again:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  $ dig -x 192.168.196.4 +pfmin
  ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
  ;; got answer:
  ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 8764
  ;; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1
  ;; QUERY SECTION:
  ;;      4.196.168.192.in-addr.arpa, type = ANY, class = IN

  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  4.196.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  3D IN PTR  mail.linux.bogus.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  so, it looks OK, dump the whole thing to examine that too:



  ______________________________________________________________________

  Looks good!  If your output didn't look like that look for error-
  messages in your syslog, I explained how to do that in the first
  section under the heading ``Starting named''


  5.4.  Words of caution

  There are some things I should add here.  The IP numbers used in the
  examples above are taken from one of the blocks of 'private nets',
  i.e., they are not allowed to be used publicly on the Internet.  So
  they are safe to use in an example in a HOWTO.  The second thing is
  the notify no; line.  It tells named not to notify its secondary
  (slave) servers when it has gotten a update to one of its zone files.
  In BIND-8 the named can notify the other servers listed in NS records
  in the zone file when a zone is updated.  This is handy for ordinary
  use.  But for private experiments with zones this feature should be
  off --- we don't want the experiment to pollute the Internet do we?


  And, of course, this domain is highly bogus, and so are all the
  addresses in it.  For a real example of a real-life domain see the
  next main-section.


  5.5.  Why reverse lookups don't work.

  There are a couple of ``gotchas'' that normally are avoided with name
  lookups that are often seen when setting up reverse zones.  Before you
  go on you need reverse lookups of your machines working on your own
  nameserver.  If it isn't go back and fix it before continuing.



  I will discuss two failures of reverse lookups as seen from outside
  your network:


  5.5.1.  The reverse zone isn't delegated.

  When you ask a service provider for a network-address range and a
  domain name the domain name is normally delegated as a matter of
  course.  A delegation is the glue NS record that helps you get from
  one nameserver to another as explained in the dry theory section
  above.  You read that, right?  If your reverse zone doesn't work go
  back and read it.  Now.


  The reverse zone also needs to be delegated.  If you got the
  192.168.196 net with the linux.bogus domain from your provider they
  need to put NS records in for your reverse zone as well as for your
  forward zone.  If you follow the chain from in-addr.arpa and up to
  your net you will probably find a break in the chain, most probably at
  your service provider.  Having found the break in the chain contact
  your service-provider and ask them to correct the error.


  5.5.2.  You've got a classless subnet

  This is a somewhat advanced topic, but classless subnets are very
  common these days and you probably have one if you're a small company.


  A classless subnet is what keeps the Internet going these days.  Some
  years ago there was much ado about the shortage of IP numbers.  The
  smart people in IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force, they keep
  the Internet working) stuck their heads together and solved the
  problem.  At a price.  The price is that you'll get less than a ``C''
  subnet and some things may break.  Please see Ask Mr. DNS at
  <http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/00007.htm> for an good explanation of
  this and how to handle it.


  Did you read it?  I'm not going to explain it so please read it.


  The first part of the problem is that your ISP must understand the
  technique described by Mr. DNS.  Not all small ISPs have a working
  understanding of this.  If so you might have to explain to them and be
  persistent.  But be sure you understand it first ;-).  They will then
  set up a nice reverse zone at their server which you can examine for
  correctness with dig.


  The second and last part of the problem is that you must understand
  the technique.  If you're unsure go back and read about it again.
  Then you can set up your own classless reverse zone as described by
  Mr. DNS.


  There is another trap lurking here.  Old resolvers will not be able to
  follow the CNAME trick in the resolving chain and will fail to
  reverse-resolve your machine.  This can result in the service
  assigning it an incorrect access class, deny access or something along
  those lines.  If you stumble into such a service the only solution
  (that I know of) is for your ISP to insert your PTR record directly
  into their trick classless zone file instead of the trick CNAME
  record.


  Some ISPs will offer other ways to handle this, like Web based forms
  for you to input your reverse-mappings in or other automagical
  systems.


  5.6.  Slave servers

  Once you have set up your zones correctly on the master servers you
  need to set up at least one slave server.  Slave servers are needed
  for robustness.  If your master goes down the people out there on the
  net will still be able to get information about your domain from the
  slave.  A slave should be as long away from you as possible.  Your
  master and slave should share as few as possible of these: Power
  supply, LAN, ISP, city and country.  If all of these things are
  different for your master and slave you've found a really good slave.


  A slave is simply a nameserver that copies zone files from a master.
  You set it up like this:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  zone "linux.bogus" {
          type slave;
          file "sz/linux.bogus";
          masters { 192.168.196.2; };
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  A mechanism called zone-transfer is used to copy the data.  The zone
  transfer is controlled by your SOA record:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  @       IN      SOA     ns.linux.bogus. hostmaster.linux.bogus. (
                          199802151       ; serial, todays date + todays serial #
                          8H              ; refresh, seconds

  A zone is only transferred if the serial number on the master is
  larger than on the slave.  Every refresh interval the slave will check
  if the master has been updated.  If the check fails (because the
  master is unavailable) it will retry the check every retry interval.
  If it continues to fail as long as the expire interval the slave will
  remove the zone from it's filesystem and no longer be a server for it.



  6.  Basic security options.

  By Jamie Norrish


  Setting configuration options to reduce the possibility of problems.



  There are a few simple steps that you can take which will both make
  your server more secure and potentially reduce its load. The material
  presented here is nothing more than a starting point; if you are
  concerned about security (and you should be), please consult other
  resources on the net (see ``the last chapter'').


  The following configuration directives occur in named.conf. If a
  directive occurs in the options section of the file, it applies to all
  zones listed in that file. If it occurs within a zone entry, it
  applies only to that zone. A zone entry overrides an options entry.


  6.1.  Restricting zone transfers

  In order for your slave server(s) to be able to answer queries about
  your domain, they must be able to transfer the zone information from
  your primary server.  Very few others have a need to do so.  Therefore
  restrict zone transfers using the allow-transfer option, assuming
  192.168.1.4 is the IP address of ns.friend.bogus and adding yourself
  for debugging purposes:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  zone "linux.bogus" {
        allow-transfer { 192.168.1.4; localhost; };
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  By restricting zone transfers you ensure that the only information
  available to people is that which they ask for directly - no one can
  just ask for all the details about your set-up.


  6.2.  Protecting against spoofing

  Firstly, disable any queries for domains you don't own, except from
  your internal/local machines. This not only helps prevent malicious
  use of your DNS server, but also reduces unnecessary use of your
  server.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  options {
        allow-query { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
  };

  zone "linux.bogus" {
        allow-query { any; };
  };

  zone "196.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        allow-query { any; };
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Further, disable recursive queries except from internal/local sources.
  This reduces the risk of cache poisoning attacks (where false data is
  fed to your server).

  ______________________________________________________________________
  options {
          allow-recursion { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6.3.  Running named as non-root

  It is a good idea to run named as a user other than root, so that if
  it is compromised the privileges gained by the cracker are as limited
  as possible. You first have to create a user and group for named to
  run under, and then modify whatever init script you use that starts
  named. Pass the new username and group to named using the -u and -g
  flags.


  For example, in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 you might modify your
  /etc/init.d/bind script to have the following line (where user and
  group named have been created:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec /usr/sbin/named -- -u named -g named
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The same can be done with Red Hat and the other distributions. Dave
  Lugo has described a secure dual chroot setup
  <http://www.etherboy.com/dns/chrootdns.html> which you may find
  interesting to read.


  7.  A real domain example

  Where we list some real zone files


  Users have suggested that I include a real example of a working domain
  as well as the tutorial example.


  I use this example with permission from David Bullock of LAND-5.
  These files were current 24th of September 1996, and were then edited
  to fit BIND 8 restrictions and use extensions by me.  So, what you see
  here differs a bit from what you find if you query LAND-5's name
  servers now.


  7.1.  /etc/named.conf (or /var/named/named.conf)

  Here we find master zone sections for the two reverse zones needed:
  the 127.0.0 net, as well as LAND-5's 206.6.177 subnet, and a primary
  line for land-5's forward zone land-5.com. Also note that instead of
  stuffing the files in a directory called pz, as I do in this HOWTO, he
  puts them in a directory called zone.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  // Boot file for LAND-5 name server

  options {
          directory "/var/named";
  };

  zone "." {
          type hint;
          file "root.hints";
  };

  zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
          type master;
          file "zone/127.0.0";
  };

  zone "land-5.com" {
          type master;
          file "zone/land-5.com";
  };

  zone "177.6.206.in-addr.arpa" {
          type master;
          file "zone/206.6.177";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  If you put this in your named.conf file to play with PLEASE put
  ``notify no;'' in the zone sections for the two land-5 zones so as to
  avoid accidents.


  7.2.  /var/named/root.hints

  Keep in mind that this file is dynamic, and the one listed here is
  old. You're better off using one produced now, with dig, as explained
  earlier.

  7.3.  /var/named/zone/127.0.0

  Just the basics, the obligatory SOA record, and a record that maps
  127.0.0.1 to localhost.  Both are required.  No more should be in this
  file.  It will probably never need to be updated, unless your
  nameserver or hostmaster address changes.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  @               IN      SOA     land-5.com. root.land-5.com. (
                                  199609203       ; Serial
                                  28800   ; Refresh
                                  7200    ; Retry
                                  604800  ; Expire
                                  86400)  ; Minimum TTL
                          NS      land-5.com.

  1                       PTR     localhost.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  If you look at a random BIND installation you will probably find that
  the $TTL line is missing as it is here.  It was not used before, and
  only version 8.2 of BIND has started to warn about its absence.  I
  would recommend that you put the $TTL in line in zone files as you
  discover that they are missing.


  7.4.  /var/named/zone/land-5.com

  Here we see the mandatory SOA record, the needed NS records.  We can
  see that he has a secondary name server at ns2.psi.net.  This is as it
  should be, always have a off site secondary server as backup.  We can
  also see that he has a master host called land-5 which takes care of
  many of the different Internet services, and that he's done it with
  CNAMEs (a alternative is using A records).


  As you see from the SOA record, the zone file originates at
  land-5.com, the contact person is root@land-5.com. hostmaster is
  another oft used address for the contact person.  The serial number is
  in the customary yyyymmdd format with todays serial number appended;
  this is probably the sixth version of zone file on the 20th of
  September 1996.  Remember that the serial number must increase
  monotonically, here there is only one digit for todays serial#, so
  after 9 edits he has to wait until tomorrow before he can edit the
  file again.  Consider using two digits.



  ______________________________________________________________________

  ______________________________________________________________________



  If you examine land-5s nameserver you will find that the host names
  are of the form ws_number.  As of late BIND 4 versions named started
  enforcing the restrictions on what characters may be used in host
  names.  So that does not work with BIND-8 at all, and I substituted
  '-' (dash) for '_' (underline) for use in this HOWTO.


  Another thing to note is that the workstations don't have individual
  names, but rather a prefix followed by the two last parts of the IP
  numbers.  Using such a convention can simplify maintenance
  significantly, but can be a bit impersonal, and, in fact, be a source
  of irritation among your customers.


  We also see that funn.land-5.com is an alias for land-5.com, but using
  an A record, not a CNAME record.  This is a good policy as noted
  earlier.

  ______________________________________________________________________



  The reverse zone is the bit of the setup that seems to cause the most
  grief.  It is used to find the host name if you have the IP number of
  a machine.  Example: you are an IRC server and accept connections from
  IRC clients.  However you are a Norwegian IRC server and so you only
  want to accept connections from clients in Norway and other
  Scandinavian countries.  When you get a connection from a client the C
  library is able to tell you the IP number of the connecting machine
  because the IP number of the client is contained in all the packets
  that are passed over the network.  Now you can call a function called
  gethostbyaddr that looks up the name of a host given the IP number.
  Gethostbyaddr will ask a DNS server, which will then traverse the DNS
  looking for the machine.  Supposing the client connection is from
  ws-177200.land-5.com.  The IP number the C library provides to the IRC
  server is 206.6.177.200.  To find out the name of that machine we need
  to find 200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa.  The DNS server will first find
  the arpa. servers, then find in-addr.arpa.  servers, following the
  reverse trail through 206, then 6 and at last finding the server for
  the 177.6.206.in-addr.arpa zone at LAND-5.  From which it will finally
  get the answer that for 200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa we have a ``PTR
  ws-177200.land-5.com'' record, meaning that the name that goes with
  206.6.177.200 is ws-177200.land-5.com.  As with the explanation of how
  prep.ai.mit.edu is looked up, this is slightly fictitious.


  Getting back to the IRC server example.  The IRC server only accepts
  connections from the Scandinavian countries, i.e., *.no, *.se, *.dk,
  the name ws-177200.land-5.com clearly does not match any of those, and
  the server will deny the connection.  If there was no reverse mapping
  of 206.2.177.200 through the in-addr.arpa zone the server would have
  been unable to find the name at all and would have to settle to
  comparing 206.2.177.200 with *.no, *.se and *.dk, none of which will
  match.


  Some people will tell you that reverse lookup mappings are only
  important for servers, or not important at all.  Not so: Many ftp,
  news, IRC and even some http (WWW) servers will not accept connections
  from machines of which they are not able to find the name.  So reverse
  mappings for machines are in fact mandatory.


  8.  Maintenance

  Keeping it working.


  There is one maintenance task you have to do on nameds, other than
  keeping them running.  That's keeping the root.hints file updated.
  The easiest way is using dig. First run dig with no arguments you will
  get the root.hints according to your own server.  Then ask one of the
  listed root servers with dig @rootserver.  You will note that the
  output looks terribly like a root.hints file.  Save it to a file (dig
  @e.root-servers.net . ns >root.hints.new) and replace the old
  root.hints with it.


  Remember to reload named after replacing the cache file.


  Al Longyear sent me this script that can be run automatically to
  update root.hints.  Install a crontab entry to run it once a month and
  forget it.  The script assumes you have mail working and that the
  mail-alias `hostmaster' is defined.  You must hack it to suit your
  setup.

  Some of you might have picked up that the root.hints file is also
  available by ftp from Internic.  Please don't use ftp to update
  root.hints, the above method is much more friendly to the net, and
  Internic.


  9.  Converting from version 4 to version 8

  This was originally a section on using BIND 8 written by David E.
  Smith (dave@bureau42.ml.org).  I have edited it some to fit the new
  section name.


  There's not much to it. Except for using named.conf instead of
  named.boot, everything is identical. And BIND 8 comes with a perl
  script that converts old-style files to new. Example named.boot (old
  style) for a cache-only name server:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  directory /var/named
  cache   .                                     root.hints
  primary 0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA                    127.0.0.zone
  primary localhost                               localhost.zone
  ______________________________________________________________________



  On the command line, in the bind8/src/bin/named directory (this
  assumes you got a source distribution.  If you got a binary package
  the script is probably around, I'm not sure where it would be though.
  -ed.), type:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  ./named-bootconf.pl < named.boot > named.conf
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Which creates named.conf:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  // generated by named-bootconf.pl

  options {
          directory "/var/named";
  };

  zone "." {
          type hint;
          file "root.hints";
  };

  zone "0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {
          type master;
          file "127.0.0.zone";
  };

  zone "localhost" {
          type master;
          file "localhost.zone";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  It works for everything that can go into a named.boot file, although
  it doesn't add all of the new enhancements and configuration options
  that BIND 8 allows.  Here's a more complete named.conf that does the
  same things, but a little more efficiently.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  // This is a configuration file for named (from BIND 8.1 or later).
  // It would normally be installed as /etc/named.conf.
  // The only change made from the `stock' named.conf (aside from this
  // comment :) is that the directory line was uncommented, since I
  // already had the zone files in /var/named.

  options {
          directory "/var/named";
          datasize 20M;
  };

  zone "localhost" IN {
          type master;
          file "localhost.zone";
  };

  zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" IN {
          type master;
          file "127.0.0.zone";
  };

  zone "." IN {
          type hint;
          file "root.hints";
  };
  ______________________________________________________________________



  In the BIND 8 distributions directory bind8/src/bin/named/test you
  find this, and copies of the zone files, that many people can just
  drop in and use instantly.
  The formats for zone files and root.hints files are identical, as are
  the commands for updating them.


  10.  Questions and Answers

  Please read this section before mailing me.


  1. My named wants a named.boot file


     You are reading the wrong HOWTO.  Please see the old version of
     this HOWTO, which covers BIND 4, at
     <http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/DNS/>


  2. How do use DNS from inside a firewall?


     A hint: forward only;.  You might also need


     ___________________________________________________________________
       query-source port 53;

     ___________________________________________________________________



  inside the ``options'' part of the named.conf file as suggested in the
  example ``caching'' section.


  3. How do I make DNS rotate through the available addresses for a
     service, say www.busy.site to obtain a load balancing effect, or
     similar?


     Make several A records for www.busy.site and use BIND 4.9.3 or
     later.  Then BIND will round-robin the answers.  It will not work
     with earlier versions of BIND.


  4. I want to set up DNS on a (closed) intranet.  What do I do?


     You drop the root.hints file and just do zone files.  That also
     means you don't have to get new hint files all the time.


  5. How do I set up a secondary (slave) name server?


     If the primary/master server has address 127.0.0.1 you put a line
     like this in the named.conf file of your secondary:



     ___________________________________________________________________
       zone "linux.bogus" {
             type slave;
             file "sz/linux.bogus";
             masters { 127.0.0.1; };
       };

     ___________________________________________________________________



  You may list several alternate master servers the zone can be copied
  from inside the masters list, separated by ';' (semicolon).


  6. I want BIND running when I'm disconnected from the net.


     There are four items regarding this:


    Specific to BIND 8, Adam L Rice has sent me this e-mail, about how
     to run DNS painlessly on a dialup machine:



       I have discovered with newer versions of BIND that this
       [<em/shuffeling files, -ed/] is no longer necessary.  There is a
       "forward" directive in addition to the "forwarders" directive that
       controls how they are used.  The default setting is "forward first",
       which first asks each of the forwarders, and then tries the normal
       approach of doing the legwork itself if that fails.  This gives the
       familiar behaviour of gethostbyname() taking an inordinately long time
       when the link is not up.  But if "forward only" is set, then BIND
       gives up when it doesn't get a response from the forwarders, and
       gethostbyname() returns immediately.  Hence there is no need to
       perform sleight-of-hand with files in /etc and restart the server.

       In my case, I just added the lines

       forward only;
       forwarders { 193.133.58.5; };

       to the options { } section of my named.conf file. It works very nicely. The
       only disadvantage of this is that it reduces an incredibly sophisticated
       piece of DNS software to the status of a dumb cache. To some extent, I would
       just like to run a dumb cache for DNS instead, but there doesn't seem to be
       such a piece of software available for Linux.



    I have received this mail from Ian Clark <ic@deakin.edu.au> where
     he explains his way of doing this:



  I run named on my 'Masquerading' machine here. I have
  two root.hints files, one called root.hints.real which contains
  the real root server names and the other called root.hints.fake
  which contains...

  ----
  ; root.hints.fake
  ; this file contains no information
  ----

  When I go off line I copy the root.hints.fake file to root.hints and
  restart named.

  When I go online I copy root.hints.real to root.hints and restart
  named.

  This is done from ip-down & ip-up respectively.

  The first time I do a query off line on a domain name named doesn't
  have details for it puts an entry like this in messages..

  Jan 28 20:10:11 hazchem named[10147]: No root nameserver for class IN

  which I can live with.

  It certainly seems to work for me. I can use the nameserver for
  local machines while off the 'net without the timeout delay for
  external domain names and I while on the 'net queries for external
  domains work normally



  Peter Denison thought that Ian does not go far enough though.  He
  writes:



  When connected) serve all cached (and local network) entries immediately
                  for non-cached entries, forward to my ISPs nameserver
  When off-line)  serve local network queries immediately
                  fail all other queries **immediately**

  The combination of changing the root cache file and forwarding queries
  doesn't work.

  So, I've set up (with some discussion of this on the local LUG) two nameds
  as follows:

  named-online:   forwards to ISPs nameserver
                  master for localnet zone
                  master for localnet reverse zone (1.168.192.in-addr.arpa)
                  master for 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa
                  listens on port 60053

  named-offline:  no forwarding
                  "fake" root cache file
                  slave for 3 local zones (master is 127.0.0.1:60053)
                  listens on port 61053

  And combined this with port forwarding, to send port 53 to 61053 when
  off-line, and to port 60053 when online. (I'm using the new netfilter
  package under 2.3.18, but the old (ipchains) mechanism should work.)

  Note that this won't quite work out-of-the-box, as there's a slight bug in
  BIND 8.2, which I have logged wth the developers, preventing a slave
  having a master on the same IP address (even if a different port). It's a
  trivial patch, and should go in soon I hope.



    I have also received information about how BIND interacts with NFS
     and the portmapper on a mostly offline machine from Karl-Max
     Wanger:



       I use to run my own named on all my machines which are only
       occasionally connected to the Internet by modem. The nameserver only
       acts as a cache, it has no area of authority and asks back for
       everything at the name servers in the root.cache file. As is usual
       with Slackware, it is started before nfsd and mountd.

       With one of my machines (a Libretto 30 notebook) I had the problem
       that sometimes I could mount it from another system connected to my
       local LAN, but most of the time it didn't work.  I had the same effect
       regardless of using PLIP, a PCMCIA ethernet card or PPP over a serial
       interface.

       After some time of guessing and experimenting I found out that
       apparently named messed with the process of registration nfsd and
       mountd have to carry out with the portmapper upon startup (I start
       these daemons at boot time as usual). Starting named after nfsd and
       mountd eliminated this problem completely.

       As there are no disadvantages to expect from such a modified boot
       sequence I'd advise everybody to do it that way to prevent potential
       trouble.



    Finally, there is HOWTO information about this at Ask Mr. DNS at
     <http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/#linux-dialup>.  It is about BIND 4
     though, so you have to adapt what he says to BIND 8.


  7. Where does the caching name server store its cache? Is there any
     way I can control the size of the cache?


     The cache is completely stored in memory, it is not written to disk
     at any time.  Every time you kill named the cache is lost.  The
     cache is not controllable in any way.  named manages it according
     to some simple rules and that is it.  You cannot control the cache
     or the cache size in any way for any reason. If you want to you can
     ``fix'' this by hacking named.  This is however not recommended.


  8. Does named save the cache between restarts?  Can I make it save it?


     No, named does not save the cache when it dies.  That means that
     the cache must be built anew each time you kill and restart named.
     There is no way to make named save the cache in a file.  If you
     want you can ``fix'' this by hacking named.  This is however not
     recommended.


  9. How can I get a domain? I want to set up my own domain called (for
     example) linux-rules.net.  How can I get the domain I want assigned
     to me?


     Please contact your network service provider.  They will be able to
     help you with this.  Please note that in most parts of the world
     you need to pay money to get a domain.


  10.
     How can I secure my DNS server?  How do I set up split DNS?


     Both of these are advanced topics.  They are both covered in
     <http://www.etherboy.com/dns/chrootdns.html>.  I will not explain
     the topics further here.



  11.  How to become a bigger time DNS admin.

  Documentation and tools.


  Real Documentation exists.  Online and in print.  The reading of
  several of these is required to make the step from small time DNS
  admin to a big time one.  In print I have written The Concise Guide to
  DNS and BIND (by Nicolai Langfeldt), published by Que (ISDN
  0-7897-2273-9).  The book is much like this HOWTO.  Just more details,
  and a lot more of everything.  But the standard book is DNS and BIND
  by C. Liu and P. Albitz from O'Reilly & Associates (ISBN
  0-937175-82-X).  It's excellent too.  Get the 3rd edition, it covers
  BIND 8 as well as BIND 4.  There is also a section on DNS in TCP/IP
  Network Administration, by Craig Hunt from O'Reilly (ISBN
  0-937175-82-X).  Another must for good DNS administration (or good
  anything for that matter) is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
  by Robert M. Pirsig :-) Available as ISBN 0688052304 and others.

  Online you will find stuff on  <http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/> (DNS
  Resources Directory),  <http://www.isc.org/bind.html>; A FAQ, a
  reference manual (BOG; BIND Operations Guide) as well as papers and
  protocol definitions and DNS hacks (these, and most, if not all, of
  the RFCs mentioned below, are also contained in the BIND
  distribution).  I have not read most of these, but then I'm not a big-
  time DNS admin either.  Arnt Gulbrandsen on the other hand has read
  BOG and he's ecstatic about it :-).  The newsgroup
  <news:comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains> is about DNS.  In addition there
  are a number of RFCs about DNS, the most important are probably the
  ones listed here.  Those that have BCP (Best Current Practice) numbers
  are highly recommended.
