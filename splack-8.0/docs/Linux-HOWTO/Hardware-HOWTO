30. Glossary

1. Introduction

This document lists most of the hardware components (not whole computers)
known to be supported or not supported under Linux, so reading through this
document you can choose the components for your own Linux computer and know
what to avoid. As the list of components supported by Linux changes
constantly, this document will never be complete. If a component is not
mentioned in this HOWTO, I simply have not found support for the component
and nobody has told me about support.

Subsections titled 'Alpha, Beta drivers' list hardware with alpha or beta
drivers in varying degrees of usability. Note that some drivers only exist in
alpha kernels, so if you see something listed as supported but isn't in your
version of the Linux kernel, upgrade.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. Notes on binary-only drivers

Some devices are supported by binary-only modules; avoid these when you can.
Binary-only modules are modules which are compiled for ONE kernel version.
The source code for these modules has NOT been released. This may prevent you
from upgrading or maintaining your system. It will also prevent you from
using the component on alternate (usually non-x86) architectures.

Linus Torvalds says "I allow binary-only modules, but I want people to know
that they are _only_ ever expected to work on the one version of the kernel
that they were compiled for." (See [http://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/
lt-binary.html] http://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/lt-binary.html for the rest of the
message.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. Notes on commercial drivers

Various commercial drivers for sound, video, etc. exist for Linux. Tracking
these commercial drivers is beyond the scope of this document. These drivers
might be mentioned at various points in this document, but note that no
effort has been made to make sure that this information is current.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3. System architectures

This document primarily deals with Linux for x86-based platforms. For other
platforms, check the following:

  * [http://www.alphalinux.org/] Alpha
   
  * [http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/] ARM
   
  * [http://www.linuxia64.org/] IA-64
   
  * [http://www.linux-m68k.org/] m68k
   
  * [http://www.linux-mips.org/] MIPS
   
  * [http://www.parisc-linux.org/] PA-RISC
   
  * [http://www.linuxppc.org/] PowerPC
   
  * [http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390/] S/390
   
  * [http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/] SuperH
   
  * [http://www.ultralinux.org/] SPARC
   

There are also the [http://www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/] ELKS and [http://
www.uclinux.org/] uClinux ports, which are forks of the mainstream kernel
source designed for MMU-less (mostly very low-end and embedded) systems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4. Known problems with this document

This document can't possibly be up-to-date at all times. I would like to see
this document be a useful reference again. The following items need to be
fixed for that to happen:

  * Old cruft needs to be eliminated. Much of this document was written in
    1995, give or take, when PCI was new and not supported terribly well, and
    ISA PnP was seen as something evil. Oh, how the times have changed...
   
    Also, many of the model numbers listed in this document are no longer
    available, and are probably not of much interest to the vast majority of
    people. Personally, I think hardware that hasn't been available for more
    than 5 years or so can safely be removed. Old versions of this document
    will always be available on the Internet...
   
  * URLs in this document need updating. I've begun to do that, but it is a
    big job... Diffs are welcome.
   
  * In the process of updating and converting this document to DocBook, some
    cruft was introduced. If anyone wants to help clean up this, get the
    latest source (preferably by emailing me at <steve@silug.org>) and grep
    for "FIXME".
   
  * Lists in this HOWTO that are available in other HOWTOs or FAQs need to be
    either updated here or dropped completely from this document. (A good
    example is the list of video cards supported by XFree86.)
   
  * Newer interfaces such as USB need to be added into the list. (Would a
    USB-attached hard drive go under "USB", "Removable drives", "Hard
    drives", or all of the above?)
   
  * And, of course, random hardware that just isn't listed in this document
    needs to be added.
   

All of this is going to require a lot of work. If this happens to interest
you, please email <steve@silug.org>. I can use the help. :-)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5. New versions of this document

The latest version of this document can be found on the Linux Documentation
Project home site or any of its many mirrors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.6. Feedback and corrections

If you have questions or comments about this document, please feel free to
email Steven Pritchard at <steve@silug.org>. I also welcome corrections and
additions. At some point in the near future, I plan to set up a web interface
for adding components to this document. In the mean time, please just use the
word "hardware" somewhere in the subject when sending corrections or
additions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.7. Acknowledgments

This document has passed through many hands. I don't know if he wrote the
first version, but in 1993 Ed Carp was maintaining it. In August of 1994,
FRiC (Boy of Destiny) took over. After he fell off the face of the planet in
late 1995 or early 1996 (and we all miss him from IRC, I might add), Patrick
Reijnen took over (sometime in 1997) and continued to maintain this document
until late 1999.

Recent versions of this document contained the following:

   
    Thanks to all the authors and contributors of other HOWTO's, many things
    here are shamelessly stolen from their works; to FRiC, Zane Healy and Ed
    Carp, the original authors of this HOWTO; and to everyone else who sent
    in updates and feedbacks. Special thanks to Eric Boerner and lilo (the
    person, not the program) for the sanity checks. And thanks to Dan Quinlan
    for the original SGML conversion.
   
Many thanks to all those who have contributed to this document over the
years.

In addition, I'd like to thank the many members of the Southern Illinois
Linux Users Group and the Linux Users of Central Illinois for giving me so
many interesting problems to solve over the years, and, of course, my wife
Kara for putting up with me all these years. :-)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Computers/Motherboards/BIOS

ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI, and AGP buses are all supported. All recent motherboards
should work fine, although certain integrated controllers may or may not work
well (or at all).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Specific system/motherboard/BIOS

The following are old notes and may be out of date. This section will be
updated soon.

  * IBM PS/2 MCA systems
   
    Supported since kernel version 2.0.7, but only for the stable kernel
    releases. For information you can look at the [http://www.dgmicro.com/
    default.htm] Micro Channel Linux Home Page. Software for MCA systems can
    be found [ftp://ftp.dgmicro.com/pub/linuxmca] here. Information on the
    MCA SCSI subsystem can be found [http//www.uni-mainz.de/~langm000/
    linux.html] here.
   
  * EFA E5TX-AT motherboard has a solvable problem with RedHat Linux 5.0 and
    possibly other versions of Linux. It spontaneously reboots while probing
    hardware. To solve, update BIOS to version 1.01. Get the BIOS update
    [http://www.efacorp.com/download/bios/e5tx103.exe] here.
   
  * The Edom MP080 motherboard needs a BIOS flash for Linux to work. Without
    the BIOS flash Linux will reboot during the hardware scan. For the BIOS
    flash check [http://www.edom.com/tech/tech.htm] here and [http://
    www.edom.com/download] here.
   
  * The Zida 6MLX motherboard with PII Intel LX chipset is mentioned only to
    work with Linux when the PII cache is disabled in BIOS. BIOS upgrade does
    not solve the problem. Symptom is random reboots during or shortly after
    system boot.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Unsupported

  * Supermicro P5MMA with BIOS versions 1.36, 1.37 and 1.4. Linux will not
    boot on this motherboard. A new (beta) release of the BIOS which makes
    Linux boot, is available [ftp.supermicro.com/mma9051.zip] here.
   
  * Supermicro P5MMA98. Linux will not boot on this motherboard. A new (beta)
    release of the BIOS which makes Linux boot, is available
    [ftp.supermicro.com/a98905.zip] here.
   
  * DataExpert Corp. ExpertColor TX531 V1.0 motherboard with chipset ACER
    M1531 (Date: 9729, TS6) and ACER M1543 (Date: 9732 TS6) seems to present
    not reproducible segmentations faults, kernel oops and kernel hangs under
    heavy load and tape access. The problem seems to be the PCI-bus,
    respectively the ACER chipset.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. PCMCIA

  * [http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/] PCMCIA
   

PCMCIA drivers currently support all common PCMCIA controllers, including
Databook TCIC/2, Intel i82365SL, Cirrus PD67xx, and Vadem VG-468 chipsets.
Motorola 6AHC05GA controller used in some Hyundai laptops is not supported.
See Appendix B for a list of supported PCMCIA cards.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. CPU/FPU

4.1. Intel

Intel 386SX/DX/SL, 486SX/DX/SL/SX2/DX2/DX4, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II,
Pentium III (regular and Xeon versions), Pentium 4, and Celeron are all
supported.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. AMD

AMD 386SX/DX, 486SX/DX/DX2/DX4, K5, K6, K6-2, K6-3, and Athlon are all
supported. Older versions of K6 should be avoided as they are buggy. Setting
"internal cache" disabled in bios setup can be a workaround. Some early K6-2
300Mhz have problems with the system chips.

The old NexGen processors are also supported.

A few very early AMD 486DX's may hang in some special situations. All current
chips should be okay and getting a chip swap for old CPU's should not be a
problem.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. Cyrix

Cyrix 386SX/DX, 486SX/DX, 5x86, 6x86, and MediaGX are all supported.

  * [ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/CxPatch030.tar.z] enable
    cache on Cyrix processors
   
  * [ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/linux.cxpatch] Cyrix
    software cache control
   
  * [ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/cx5x86mod_1.0c.tgz] Cyrix
    5x86 CPU register settings
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. IDT

[http://www.winchip.com/] IDT Winchip C6-PSME2006A processors are supported
under Linux.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5. Transmeta

The Transmeta [http://www.transmeta.com/crusoe/] Crusoe processors are
supported.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6. Misc. notes

Linux has built-in FPU emulation if you don't have a math coprocessor.

Linux supports SMP (multiple CPUs) in all 2.x kernels. See the Linux SMP
HOWTO for more information.

ULSI Math*Co series has a bug in the FSAVE and FRSTOR instructions that
causes problems with all protected mode operating systems. Some older IIT and
Cyrix chips may also have this problem.

There are problems with TLB flushing in UMC U5S chips in very old kernels.
(1.1.x)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Memory

All memory like DRAM, EDO and SDRAM can be used with Linux. Be aware that
older kernels or kernels running on a mortherboard with an older BIOS may
only be able to detect 64MB of RAM. If you have this problem, when you add
more than 64 Mb of memory you have to add the following line to your LILO
configuration file:

   
    append="mem=<number of Mb>M"
   
So when you have 96 MB of memory this should become

   
    append="mem=96M"
   
Don't use a number higher than the amount of RAM you really have. This will
cause crashes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Video cards

Linux will work with all video cards in text mode, VGA cards not listed below
probably will still work with mono VGA and/or standard VGA drivers.

If you're looking into buying a cheap video card to run X, keep in mind that
accelerated cards (ATI Mach, ET4000/W32p, S3) are MUCH faster than
unaccelerated or partially accelerated (Cirrus, WD) cards.

"32 bpp" is actually 24 bit color aligned on 32 bit boundaries. It does NOT
mean the cards are capable of 32 bit color, they still display 24 bit color
(16,777,216 colors). 24 bit packed pixels modes are not supported in XFree86,
so cards that can do 24 bit modes to get higher resolutions in other OS's are
not able to do this in X using XFree86. These cards include Mach32, Cirrus
542x, S3 801/805/868/968, ET4000, and others.

AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) support is growing fast. Most of the
X-servers (both freely available and commercial versions) have more or less
support for AGP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. XFree86

Please note that this section has not been updated recently!

For the most recent information about cards and chipsets supported by
XFree86, see the Driver Status page and the XFree86 3.3.6 card list.

might give better performances for cards that are supported by XFree86.
Contact the vendors directly or check the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
Commercial-HOWTO.html] Commercial HOWTO for more info.

  * Xi Graphics (Accelerated-X)
   
  * Metro Link (Metro-X)
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4. Kernel Framebuffer (fbdev)

The kernel supports a graphical console on some video cards. This support was
originally designed for non-x86 architectures which generally do not have
text-capable video cards. It was integrated into the kernel in 2.2, and now
supports various video cards.

More information can be found at [http://www.linux-fbdev.org/]
linux-fbdev.org.

The following cards are supported:

  * Amiga builtin chipset (amifb)

7. Controllers (hard drive)

Linux will work with standard IDE, MFM and RLL controllers. When using MFM/
RLL controllers it is important to use ext2fs and the bad block checking
options when formatting the disk.

Enhanced IDE (EIDE) interfaces are supported. With up to two IDE interfaces
and up to four hard drives and/or CD-ROM drives. Linux will detect these EIDE
interfaces:

  * CMD-640 (Support for buggy interfaces in kernel 2.2)
   
  * RZ1000 (Support for buggy interfaces in kernel 2.2)
   
  * AEC62XX
   
  * ALI M15x3
   
  * AMD Viper
   
  * CY82C693
   
  * Cyrix CS5530 MediaGX
   
  * HPT34X
   
  * HPT366
   
  * Intel PIIXn
   
  * NS87415
   
  * OPTi 82C621
   
  * Promise PDC20246/PDC20262/PDC20267
   
  * ServerWorks OSB4
   
  * SiS5513
   
  * SLC90E66
   
  * Tekram TRM290
   
  * VIA82CXXX
   
  * DTC 2278D
   
  * FGI/Holtek HT-6560B VLB (Support for secondary interface in kernel 2.2)
   
  * Triton I (82371FB) (with busmaster DMA)
   
  * Triton II (82371SB) (with busmaster DMA)
   
  * ALI M14xx
   
  * Promise DC4030
   
  * QDI QD6580
   
  * UMC 8672
   

ESDI controllers that emulate the ST-506 (MFM/RLL/IDE) interface will also
work. The bad block checking comment also applies to these controllers.

Generic 8 bit XT controllers also work.

Starting with pre-patch-2.0.31-3 IDE/ATAPI is provided.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1. Alpha, Beta drivers

  * UMC 8672 interfaces (experimental in kernel 2.2)
   
  * Promise DC4030VL caching interface card (experimental support in kernel
    2.2)
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Controllers (hard drive RAID)

  * Tekram D690CD IDE PCI Cache Controller (with RAID level 1 Mirroring and
    caching)
   
  * ARCO Inc. DupliDisk IDE disk mirroring controller
   
    Support for ATA, IDE, E-IDE and UDMA drive. Controllers available can be
    plugged into ISA and PCI slots, and directly into the IDE controller.
    Furthermore, 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch Bay Mount units are available that
    fit into the respective drive bays. More information at [http://
    www.arcoide.com/] Arco's web site. Make sure you have at least rev 3.00
    of the firmware.
   
  * Mylex RAID controllers
   
    More information can be found [http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/
    DAC960.html] here.
   
  * 3ware Escalade IDE RAID controllers
   
    3ware's 5000-series and 6000-series controllers have been supported since
    kernel 2.2.15. For more information, see [http://www.3ware.com/products/
    linux3ware.shtml] 3ware's web site.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Controllers (SCSI)

It is important to pick a SCSI controller carefully. Many cheap ISA SCSI
controllers are designed to drive CD-ROM's rather than anything else. Such
low end SCSI controllers are no better than IDE. See the SCSI HOWTO and look
at performance figures before buying a SCSI card.

10. Controllers (I/O)

Any standard serial/parallel/joystick/combo cards. Linux supports 8250,
16450, 16550, and 16550A UART's. Cards that support non-standard IRQ's (IRQ >
9) can be used.

See National Semiconductor's ``Application Note AN-493'' by Martin S.
Michael. Section 5.0 describes in detail the differences between the NS16550
and NS16550A. Briefly, the NS16550 had bugs in the FIFO circuits, but the
NS16550A (and later) chips fixed those. However, there were very few
NS16550's produced by National, long ago, so these should be very rare. And
many of the ``16550'' parts in actual modern boards are from the many
manufacturers of compatible parts, which may not use the National ``A''
suffix. Also, some multiport boards will use 16552 or 16554 or various other
multiport or multifunction chips from National or other suppliers (generally
in a dense package soldered to the board, not a 40 pin DIP). Mostly, don't
worry about it unless you encounter a very old 40 pin DIP National
``NS16550'' (no A) chip loose or in an old board, in which case treat it as a
16450 (no FIFO) rather than a 16550A. - Zhahai Stewart < [mailto:

12. Network adapters

Ethernet adapters vary greatly in performance. In general the newer the
design the better. Some very old cards like the 3Com 3c501 are only useful
because they can be found in junk heaps for $5 a time. Be careful with
clones, not all are good clones and bad clones often cause erratic lockups
under Linux. Read the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO.html]
Ethernet HOWTO for detailed descriptions of various cards.

E-mu MIDI synthesizer is not supported.

Nathan Laredo < [mailto:laredo@gnu.ai.mit.edu] laredo@gnu.ai.mit.edu> is
willing to write AWE32 drivers if you send him a complimentary card. He is
also willing to write drivers for almost any hardware if you send him free
samples of your hardware.

Sound Blaster 16's with DSP 4.11 and 4.12 have a hardware bug that causes
hung/stuck notes when playing MIDI and digital audio at the same time. The
problem can happen with either Wave Blaster daughterboards or MIDI devices
attached to the MIDI port. There is no known fix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Hard drives

All hard drives should work if the controller is supported.

(From the SCSI HOWTO) All direct access SCSI devices with a block size of
256, 512, or 1024 bytes should work. Other block sizes will not work (Note
that this can often be fixed by changing the block and/or sector sizes using
the MODE SELECT SCSI command).

Large IDE (EIDE) drives work fine with newer kernels. The boot partition must
lie in the first 1024 cylinders due to PC BIOS limitations.

Some Conner CFP1060S drives may have problems with Linux and ext2fs. The
symptoms are inode errors during e2fsck and corrupt file systems. Conner has
released a firmware upgrade to fix this problem, contact Conner at
1-800-4CONNER (US) or +44-1294-315333 (Europe). Have the microcode version
(found on the drive label, 9WA1.6x) handy when you call.

Many Maxtor and Western Digital IDE drives are reported to not happily
co-exist on the same IDE cable with the other manufacturers drive. Usually
one of the drives will fail during operation. Solution is to put them on
different IDE cables.

Certain Micropolis drives have problems with Adaptec and BusLogic cards,
contact the drive manufacturers for firmware upgrades if you suspect
problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.1. Unsupported

The following hard drives are mentioned as not supported by Linux. Read the
bug report available.

  * NEC D3817, D3825, D3827, D3847 "These drives are slightly non-SCSI-2
    compliant in the values reported in Mode Sense Page 3. In Mode Sense Page
    3 all NEC D38x7 drives report their sector size as zero. The NEC drives
    are the first brand of drive we have ever encountered that reported the
    sector size as zero. Unfortunately, that field in Mode Sense Page 3 is
    not modifiable and there is no way to update the firmware on the D38x7
    drives to correct this problem." Problems are mentioned for D3825 and
    D3827 (both revision 0407). Revision 0410 of these two hard drives seems
    to solve this problem.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Tape drives

15.1. Supported

  * SCSI tape drives (From the SCSI HOWTO) Drives using both fixed and
    variable length blocks smaller than the driver buffer length (set to 32k
    in the distribution sources) are supported. Virtually all drives should
    work. (Send mail if you know of any incompatible drives.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.1. Supported

Common CD-ROM drives

  * SCSI CD-ROM drives (From the CD-ROM HOWTO) Any SCSI CD-ROM drive with a
    block size of 512 or 2048 bytes should work under Linux; this includes
    the vast majority of CD-ROM drives on the market.
   
  * EIDE (ATAPI) CD-ROM drives (IDECD) Almost all double, quad and six speed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.3. Notes

All CD-ROM drives should work similarly for reading data. There are various
compatibility problems with audio CD playing utilities. (Especially with
newer low-end NEC drives.) Some alpha drivers may not have audio support yet.

Early (single speed) NEC CD-ROM drives may have trouble with currently
available SCSI controllers.

PhotoCD (XA) is supported. The hpcdtoppm program by Hadmut Danisch converts
PhotoCD files to the portable pixmap format. The program can be obtained from
[ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/hpcdtoppm] here or as part of the PBM utilities.

Also, reading video CD is supported in kernel series 2.1.3x and later. A
patch is available for kernel 2.0.30.

Finally, most IDE CD-ROM Changers are supported.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. CD-Writers

Many CD-Writers are supported by Linux now. For an up to date list of
CD-Writers supported check the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Removable drives

All SCSI drives should work if the controller is supported, including optical
(MO), WORM, floptical, Bernoulli, Zip, Jaz, SyQuest, PD, and others.

  * Panasonic MO (combines a CD-ROM drive and an optical removable disk). You
    have to set a switch when configuring the kernel to get both part work at
    the same time.
   
  * Parallel port Zip drives [ftp://gear.torque.net/pub/] here
   
  * Parallel port Avatar Shark-250 [http://www.torque.net/parport/] here
   

Removable drives work like hard disks and floppies, just fdisk / mkfs and
mount the disks. Linux provides drive locking if your drives support it.
mtools can also be used if the disks are in MS-DOS format.

CD-R drives require special software to work. Read the CD-R Mini-HOWTO.

Linux supports both 512 and 1024 bytes/sector disks. Starting with kernel
2.1.32 Linux also supports 2048 bytes/sector. A patch to kernel 2.0.30 is
available at [http://liniere.gen.u-tokyo.ac.jp/2048.html] here.

The 2048 bytes/sector support is needed for

  * Fujitsu magneto-optical disk drives M2513
   

Starting with pre-patch-2.0.31-3 IDE/ATAPI internal Zip drives, flopticals
and PD's are supported.

  * LS-120 floptical
   
  * PD-CD
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Mice

19.1. Supported

  * Microsoft serial mouse
   
  * Mouse Systems serial mouse
   
  * Logitech Mouseman serial mouse
   
  * Logitech serial mouse
   
  * ATI XL Inport busmouse
   
  * C&T 82C710 (QuickPort) (Toshiba, TI Travelmate)
   
  * Microsoft busmouse
   
  * Logitech busmouse
   
  * PS/2 (auxiliary device) mouse
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.2. Alpha, Beta drivers

  * Sejin J-mouse [ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/console/
    jmouse.1.1.70-jmouse.tar.gz] here
   
  * MultiMouse - use multiple mouse devices as single mouse [ftp://
    metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/misc/MultiMouse-1.0.tgz] here
   
  * Microsoft Intellimouse
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.3. Notes

Touchpad devices like Alps Glidepoint also work, so long they're compatible
with another mouse protocol.

Newer Logitech mice (except the Mouseman) use the Microsoft protocol and all
three buttons do work. Eventhough Microsoft's mice have only two buttons, the
protocol allows three buttons.

The mouse port on the ATI Graphics Ultra and Ultra Pro use the Logitech
busmouse protocol. (See the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
Busmouse-HOWTO.html] Busmouse HOWTO for details.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

20. Modems

All external modems connected via a RS-232 serial port should work. This
includes external ISDN adapters, although some of the extended features of
external ISDN adapaters (such as multilink) may or may not work.

Internal modems are another story, however. There are many so-called
"winmodems" available now. In fact, it seems that most PCI modems are
winmodems. Some of them do have drivers for Linux now, but many of the
drivers are often binary-only. (See the note on binary-only drivers.) See
[http://www.linmodems.org/] Linmodems.org for more information on
Linux-supported winmodems.

Note that there are external USB winmodems on the market now, so be very
careful when shopping for external modems.

Furthermore, many flash upgradable modems only have flash programs for Win95/
NT. These modems cannot be upgraded under Linux.

A small number of modems come with DOS software that downloads the control
program at runtime. These can normally be used by loading the program under
DOS and doing a warm boot. Such modems are probably best avoided as you won't
be able to use them with non PC hardware in the future.

Most 16-bit PCMCIA modems should work with the PCMCIA drivers. CardBus modems
are usually winmodems much like PCI modems. Your best bet for now is to find
a card that lists compatibility with DOS and Windows 3.1.

All that said, if a modem is known to have a real UART (or hardware UART
emulation), whether it is ISA, PCMCIA, etc., it should work under Linux.

Fax modems need appropriated fax software to operate. Also be sure that the
fax part of the modem supports Class 2 or Class 2.0. It seems to be generally
true for any fax software on unix that support for Class 1.0 is not
available.

An exception to this is the Linux efax program which supports both Class 1
and Class 2 fax modems. In some cases there can be a few (minor) technical
problems with Class 1 modems. If you have a choice it is recommend to get a
Class 2 modem.

See Appendix E Linux Incompatible Hardware for specific cards known not to
work with Linux.

The following are other good resources for finding Linux-compatible modems:

  * Rob Clark's "Winmodems are not modems" page
   
  * Andrew Comech's "PCI modems and Linux" page
   
  * Andrew Comech's "Cheap /Linux/ Box" section on modems
   
  * Linmodems.org
   

Most of the information below is from those sites.

Other useful documents include the following:

  * Modem HOWTO
   
  * Linmodem HOWTO
   
  * Winmodems and Linux HOWTO (may be superceded by the Linmodem HOWTO)
   

Below is a very incomplete list of modems currently known to work under
Linux.

22. Scanners

For scanner support there is the package SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy).
Information can be found at [http://www.mostang.com/sane/] here. It can be
downloaded from [ftp://ftp.mostang.com/pub/sane/] here. This is a universal
scanner interface. It comes complete with documentation and several frontends
and backends.

More information on handheld scanners can be found at [http://
www.willamowius.de/scanner.html] here

Many scanners also have their own, scanner specific, software packages which
include drivers.

NOTE: for the ViRGE/VX,DX,GX,GX2 chipsets you need XFree86 3.3.1 or newer.
You should use the XF86_SVGA server.

26. Appendix B. Supported PCMCIA cards

These cards are supported by David Hinds' PCMCIA package and this list is
taken from his web page ([http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/] here).

CardBus cards are listed at the end of each section. At this time, all
CardBus drivers should be treated as experimental. Beware that some cards
have 16-bit and CardBus versions with very similar names. If the CardBus
version is not specifically listed as supported here, then you should not
expect it to work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

26.1. Ethernet cards

  * SMC, Megahertz and Ositech cards use the smc91c92_cs driver
   
  * 3Com and Farallon cards use the 3c589_cs driver
   
  * Fujitsu, TDK, RATOC, CONTEC, Eagle and Nextcom cards use the fmvj18x_cs
    driver
   

All other cards use the pcnet_cs driver. Other NE2000-compatible cards that
are not on the list are also likely to work with pcnet_cs.

27. Appendix C. Supported Parallel Port devices

More and more, the parallel port is used to connect other devices than
printers. To support this parallel port drivers are written for the devicesto
work. This appendix presents devices for which parallel port support is
written.

28. Appendix D. Plug and Play devices

For people having trouble getting Plug and Play devices to work, the ISA PnP
utilities written by Peter Fox are available. Quote from the README:

These programs allow ISA Plug-And-Play devices to be configured on a Linux
machine. This program is suitable for all systems, whether or not they
include a PnP BIOS.

Commands have been taken from the Plug and Play ISA specification Version
1.0a.

More information on ISA PnP utilities can be found on the website of Peter
Fox: [http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/] here

Please let me know about hardware (not normally supported under Linux) which
can be put to work with the aid of these utilities. A list of this hardware
will be put in this appendix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29. Appendix E. Linux incompatible Hardware

Some hardware manufacturers have created devices which are compatible with
MS-DOS and Windows 95/98 only. They seem to emulate part of the normally
available hardware in the devices by software packages sold together with the
device. Specification on these devices are not presented to the world so it
is almost impossible to write drivers for these devices. Below a list of
devices reported as being Linux incompatible will be given.

Simply put, it is best to avoid hardware which states things like "Needs
Windows" or "Windows only".

  * Printers
   
      + Brother HL-820 printer
       
      + Canon LBP-465 printer
       
      + HP Deskjet 710, 720, 820 and 1000 series printers (although Windows
        only) are supported under Linux. Have a look at [http://
        www.httptech.com/ppa/] here. Be warned: Support is still in early
        development.
       
      + Lexmark 1000 inkjet printer
       
      + Lexmark 3200. For windows it has a emulation driver for HP500 and
        HP500C. Under Linux this printer will not work using a HP500 or
        HP500C driver.
       
      + Lexmark 5000 printer
       
      + Lexmark CJ5000 (ColorJet) printer

      + AT&T/Lucent winmodem
       
      + Boca Research 28.8 internal modem (model MV34AI)
       
      + Boca Research 33.6 internal modem (model MV34)(Joe Harjung has
        succeeded in configuring the modem under Win95 and then soft booting
        into Linux with the modem still working. Filippo is using this modem
        under Linux directly without any problems and without soft booting
        from Windows. I definitely need more info on these Boca Research
        modems.) The Boca Research 33.6 modem (model M336I) is mentioned to
        work with Linux. The only thing that needed to be done was diabling

30. Glossary

AGP
    Accelerated Graphics Port. A bus interconnect mechanism designed to
    improve performance of 3D graphics applications. AGP is a dedicated bus
    from the graphics subsystem to the core-logic chipset. [http://
    www.euro.dell.com/intl/euro/r+d/r+dnews/vectors/vect_2-1/v2-1_agp.htm]
    here
   
ATAPI
    AT Attachment Packet Interface. A new protocol for controlling mass
    storage devices similar to SCSI protocols. It builds on the ATA (AT
    Attachment) interface, the official ANSI Standard name for the IDE
    interface developed for hard disk drives. ATAPI is commonly used for hard
    disks, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and other devices.

RAID
    Redudant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks. The basic idea of RAID is to
    combine multiple small, inexpensive disk drives into an array of disk
    drives which yields performance exceeding that of a single large
    expensive drive. There are five types of redundant array Architectures;
    RAID-1 through RAID-5. A non-redudant array of disk drives is referred to
    as RAID-0. Some RAID systems can mix formats. [http://www.uni-mainz.de/
    ~neuffer/scsi/what_is_raid.html] (more info)
   
PPA
    Printing Performance Architecture. Protocol developed by Hewlett Packard
    for their series of Deskjet printers. In essence, the protocol moves the
    low-level processing of the data to the host computer rather than the
    printer. This allows for a low-cost printer with a small amount of memory
    and computing power and a flexible driver. However, this comes at the
    price of compatibility. HP's decision was to develop drivers only for
    Windows 95 for this printer.
   
RLL
    Run Length Limited
   
SCSI
    Small Computer Systems Interface. A standerd interface defined for all
