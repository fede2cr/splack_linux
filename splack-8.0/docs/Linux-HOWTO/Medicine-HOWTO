  2.  Medical Applications



  2.1.  Freemed

  freemed < http://www.freemed.org/> is a medical management software
  package that runs in a web browser window. It currently uses Apache,
  an SQL backend (usually MySQL, but there's an SQL Abstraction for
  this), and PHP, and is non-browser specific. It aims to duplicate all
  of the functionality of programs such as The Medical Manager, while
  remaining free to the community.

  2.2.  Freemed-YiRC

  Freemed-YiRC <http://freemed-yirc.familyandyouth.org/> is a PHP
  package based on Freemed for use with Youth in Residential Care (YiRC)
  agencies. Its aim is to be a complete package to replace legacy non-
  free apps which aren't customizable. Since it's PHP-based, all that is
  needed for the client is a good Web browser with extensive table
  support.


  2.3.  Good Electronic Health Record - GEHR

  The Good Electronic Health Record (GEHR) <http://www.gehr.org/> , a
  major part of the work of the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving
  electronic health record architecture designed to be comprehensive,
  portable and medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the
  Good European Health Record project
  <http://www.chime.ucl.ac.uk/HealthI/GEHR/> requirements statement and
  object model- the most comprehensive requirements documents ever
  developed for the electronic health record. This website is a public
  resource for documents and resources that have been used to build
  implementations of this record.


  2.4.  Conversion of ECGs - ecg2png

  ecg2png <http://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/> converts
  scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-
  friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG
  scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the
  Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also,
  typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just
  red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be compressed
  efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network
  connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the
  signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-
  suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.


  2.5.  GTDS - Oncologie Documentation (German)

  The Giessener Tumor Documentation System - GTDS was actually written
  for the Oracle database system under SCO-Unix, but works also under
  Linux, when the IBCS module is used.


  2.6.  Linux in a Doctor's Office (German)

  Karsten Hilbert < http://hilbert.webprovider.com/Linux+Praxis.html >
  <mailto:Karsten.Hilbert@gmx.net> has set up a page in German that
  describes some aspects of how to set up Linux in a doctor's office.
  It's been born from an article published in PraxisComputer 6/99.


  2.7.  Andromeda (German)

  Andromeda <http://www.frey.de> is an Open Source clinic information
  and management system in German.


  2.8.  Res Medicinae (German)

  Probably in most countries, but for sure in Germany, about 80% of
  administrative software used in medical doctor's practices are still
  based on the antique DOS operating system. Slowly, programs using
  modern graphical user interfaces (GUI) reach a share of the market.
  Most of them is based on one of the buggy but nevertheless expensive
  MS WINDOWS operating systems.

  When having bought a system, the user (doctor) is tied up to the
  provider and its updates that cost. Those are necessary due to steady
  changes in public health system and technical progress.

  Res Medicinae <http://www.resmedicinae.org> is the attempt to overcome
  high pricing in the realm of medical information systems and to
  provide users with a stable, platform independent, extensive system
  using latest technology and being open to many other medical systems.


  2.9.  Linux Port of Mallinckrodt CTN Software

  Ported by <m.stoutjesdijk@rdiag.azn.nl> Mark Stoutjesdijk
  <http://m14-060.azn.nl/ctn> from the University Hospital Nijmegen -
  Department of Diagnostic Radiology (Nijmegen MRI Research Group -
  NMRG).


  2.10.  Endoscopy

  ASD/MediTrac <http://www.meditrac.com/> announced GI-Trac (TM) 2000
  version 4.5 with native direct support for Linux. GI-Trac is a
  database and endoscopy reporting system. Licence: commercial.


  2.11.  LinuDent

  LinuDent <http://smalllinux.netpedia.net/dental/index.html> is a
  dental practice management software package that will run in console
  mode or X. The X version uses GTK, and is being developed under Linux.
  It aims to duplicate all of the functionality of full service dental
  management programs, while remaining free to the community.


  2.12.  VISIdent (German)

  The commercial VISIDent software is a GUI based information and
  accounting system for German dentists, made by BDV
  <http://www.bdv.com>.


  2.13.  Quality Documentation Statistic - QDS (German)

  QDS <http://www.havelhoehe.de/Forschung/qds_tbd.html> is an open
  source medical catalog and documentation system for the public health
  care.


  2.14.  GNUMed

  GNUMed < http://www.hherb.com/gnumed/gnumed.html> is a comprehensive
  and robust open source software package for paperless medical practice
  GNUMed is open source through and through! Each and every single tool
  used in the development process is open source. We do not use any
  proprietary software at all.

  GNUMed servers run on any open source Unix flavour like GNU/Linux and
  freeBSD as well as on proprietary software such as WinNT (which we do
  not recommend) GNUMed clients can be anything (even true thin
  clients), any platform that can use TCP/IP for network communication!

  GNUMed's main client ("administration client") has an easy to use
  graphical user interface based on the GTK+ / VDK toolkit. Other
  clients are easy to write due to well defined API much of the program
  logic is handled by the database server GNUMed is based on a robust
  SQL client-server concept and has built in mechanisms to monitor data
  base integrity at any time. If your data gets corrupted for any
  reason, you will be notified immediately! The two layer transaction
  protocol will enable you to recover from any desaster at any time.

  GNUMed features inbuilt transaction logging and data encryption to
  maximize data safety and to guarantee maximum confidentiality of
  sensitive data


  2.15.  The Littlefish Health Project

  The Littlefish
  <http://www.paninfo.com.au/intro/littlefishproject_homepage.htm>
  project is a user friendly patient information and recall system on an
  open source basis for the use by any community health organisation.
  The project will follow the GEHR or Good Electronic Health Record
  standards.


  2.16.  Free Practice Management

  FreePm <http://www.freepm.org> is an open source project to create a
  provider designed patient centered electronic medical record and
  practice management application.


  2.17.  PhysioNet

  PhysioNet <http://www.physionet.org/> offers free access via the web
  to large collections of recorded physiologic signals and related open-
  source software. PhysioNet is a public service of the Research
  Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, funded by the National
  Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health.

  The Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, to which
  PhysioNet belongs, is a cooperative project initiated by researchers
  at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical
  School, Boston University, McGill University, and MIT, under the
  auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National
  Institutes of Health. This resource, intended to stimulate current
  research and new investigations in the study of complex biomedical and
  physiologic signals, has three closely interdependent components:

  ·  PhysioNet is an on-line forum for dissemination and exchange of
     recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing
     them, by providing facilities for cooperative analysis of data and
     evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing
     free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit
     software, PhysioNet offers service and training via on-line
     tutorials to assist users at entry and more advanced levels.
     PhysioNet is a public service of the Resource, accessible via the
     World Wide Web.

  ·  PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized
     digital recordings of physiologic signals and related data for use
     by the biomedical research community. PhysioBank currently includes
     databases of multi-parameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other
     biomedical signals from healthy subjects and patients with a
     variety of conditions with major public health implications,
     including sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, epilepsy,
     gait disorders, sleep apnea, and aging. These databases will grow
     in size and scope, and will eventually include signals from
     selected in vitro and in vivo experiments, as developed and
     contributed by members of the research community.

  ·  PhysioToolkit is a large and growing library of software for
     physiologic signal processing and analysis, detection of
     physiologically significant events using both classical techniques
     and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear
     dynamics, interactive display and characterization of signals,
     creation of new databases, simulation of physiologic and other
     signals, quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis
     methods, and analysis of nonequilibrium and nonstationary
     processes. A unifying theme of the research projects that
     contribute software to PhysioToolkit is the extraction of hidden
     information from biomedical signals, information that may have
     diagnostic or prognostic value in medicine, or explanatory or
     predictive power in basic research. All PhysioToolkit software is
     available in source form under the GNU General Public License
     (GPL).

  A few interesting points not mentioned above:


  1. All of our software development is done under Linux. Contributed
     software, if not written for Linux, is ported to Linux. Almost all
     of the software is portable to other versions of UNIX, and to other
     operating systems as well.

  2. Most of our applications for physiologic signal processing,
     analysis, and visualization are built using a common library
     layered over the W3C's libwww, permitting transparent access to
     data stored locally or on web servers (in other words, these
     applications can act as independent HTTP clients). Although they
     have been designed to support collaborative research, many will be
     useful in telemedicine applications. It's a fairly simple matter to
     create new applications using the library, and there is extensive
     tutorial and reference material on-line to help you get started on
     developing your own applications.

  3. Among the collections of data are a number of standard annotated
     databases of electrocardiograms (including several such databases
     we created beginning in the mid-1970s, and others contributed by
     their creators) that are required by regulatory agencies such as
     the US FDA for testing of automated ECG analyzers in compliance
     with current ANSI and pending ISO standards. The support given us
     by the NIH NCRR allows us to make these data available freely on
     the web for the first time.

  4. About 12 GB of data are on-line now, and our queue currently
     contains another 60 GB that will be added over the next several
     months as we add disk space to our servers.


  2.18.  REALTIQ - ReAligning Tissue Quantifier

  REALTIQ stands for Re-aligning Tissue Quantification, the software is
  currently in the alpha-stage.

  Software Features:

  ·  Re-align any patient-scan to new arbitrary axes by tri-linear
     interpolation

  ·  Segmentation of long-bone tissue

  ·  Quantification of long-bone tissue


  ·  DICOM compatible


  Description:

  A pre-version of this software was developed for use in a study on the
  relations of the medullary-canal dimensions and the cortical-bone area
  at patients suffering from arthritic bone-disease.

  The problem with CAT data is, that if the model (in this case the
  hand/finger) is not properly aligned with the CAT axis, the cut-planes
  will only display a distorted view of the bone and quantitative
  measurement will yield high error-rates.

  REALTIQ reads in a set of DICOM images and displays it to the viewer
  as a frontal, sagittal and transversal view. The user can specify,
  intuitively by using the mouse, an axis through this data, as well as
  a bounding-box around that axis. The dataset will be mapped to that
  new axis, so that the structures of interest are now properly aligned.
  In a second step, the software calculates:


  ·  Medullary-canal diameters (in several directions)

  ·  Medullary-canal area / absorption rate

  ·  Cortical-bone diameters (in several directions)

  ·  Cortical-bone area / absorption rate


  For more information see: DigitalMedics <http://www.digitalmedics.de>.



  2.19.  Open Infrastructure for Outcomes

  OIO <http://www.TxOutcome.org/> is a Web-based information system for
  treatment outcome management. It is in production at the Harbor/UCLA
  Medical Center for clinical outcomes management and research data.
  Forms created with OIO and hosted on any OIO server can be downloaded
  as XML files. Once downloaded from the "Forms library" and imported
  into an OIO server, the necessary database tables are automatically
  recreated and the imported forms become immediately available to the
  users of that OIO server.


  2.20.  CTSim

  CTSim <http://www.ctsim.org/> is a Computed Tomography simulator under
  the GPL license. It simulates the process of obtaining x-ray data
  around a phantom object. It then uses various reconstruction
  algorithms for reconstructing the original image. A Web-based CGI
  interface is included.


  2.21.  myPACS

  MyPACS <http://sol.cc.u-szeged.hu/~kszabo/myPACS.html> is a Web-based
  medical image management system. It is written in PHP 3.x and uses
  MySQL for the relational database backend. It features searching
  capabilities, uploading of images and patient data from a Web browser
  into shared and private image repositories, and thumbnail creation and
  image conversion using ImageMagick. Currently MyPACS is not compatible
  with the DICOM standard.

  2.22.  LIMS - Laboratory Information Management Systems

  The LIMS ASTM Standard (E1578 Standard Guide for Laboratory
  Information Management Systems) can be found in ASTM`s Annual Book of
  Standards Volume 14.01 Healthcare Informatics; Computerized Systems
  and Chemical and Material Information. There is a small terminology
  section in this standard that covers 25 terms that relate to LIMS. The
  purpose of the standard guide is to educate new LIMS users on the
  purpose and functions and the process of procuring a LIMS.

  There is one other additional LIMS related standard in this book.
  This E2066 Standard Guide for Validation of Laboratory Information
  Management Systems.

  The BlazeLIMS Server by Blaze Systems Corporation LIMS
  <http://www.blazesystems.com/> is now supported on Linux.



  2.23.  Meditux

  Meditux <http://meditux.sourceforge.net/> is Java-servlet based
  software that provides a Web interface to MySQL or potentially any
  relational database engine which is JDBC capable. It was developed to
  support an Intranet site in a medical intensive care unit where it was
  used to collect clinical and research data.


  2.24.  XBNC

  XNBC <http://www.b3e.jussieu.fr/xnbc/> is a software package for
  simulating biological neural networks. Four neuron models are
  available, three phenomenologic models (xnbc, leaky integrator and
  conditional burster) and an ion-conductance based model. Inputs to the
  simulated neurons can be provided by experimental data stored in
  files, allowing the creation of hybrid networks. Graphic tools are
  used to describe the modeled neurons as well as the network.


  3.  Medline and Bibliography Tools


  3.1.  BioMail

  BioMail <http://phm-pf-3.pharm.sunysb.edu/biomail/> is a small Web-
  based application for medical researchers and biologists. It is
  written to automate searching for recent scientific papers in the
  PubMed Medline database. Periodically BioMail does a user-customized
  Medline search and sends all matching articles recently added to
  Medline to the user's e-mail address.


  3.2.  DubMed

  DubMed <http://dub.med.yale.edu> is a java-based Medline (Pubmed)
  interface. Its server-side backend gets search results from the Entrez
  system at the National Library of Medicine. DubMed offers a visual
  search strategy palette, and uses a journal metadata repository to
  link found citations to online journal articles when available.


  3.3.  Pybliographer

  Pybliographer <http://www.gnome.org/pybliographer/> is a tool for
  managing bibliographic databases. It supports several bibliography
  formats and can be used for searching, editing, reformatting, etc,
  through its nice graphical interface for GNOME. Due to its nature, it
  can be extended to many uses (generating HTML pages according to
  bibliographic searches, etc). It is provided with sample scripts.
  Internationalization, support for Medline, support for LyX, speedups,
  and more.

  Surfraw <http://surfraw.sourceforge.net/> (Shell Users' Revolutionary
  Front Rage Against the Web) provides a Unix command-line interface to
  a variety of popular Web search engines and sites, including Google,
  Altavista, Raging, DejaNews, Research Index, Yahoo!, WeatherNews,
  Slashdot, Freshmeat, and many others. New elvi clients for Freshmeat,
  NewScientist, MedLine, and PubMed databases (PubMed, Nucleotide,
  Protien, Genome, Structure, Popset), and support for more Google
  search types (BSD, Linux, Mac and UncleSam).


  4.  Sports and Nutrition



  4.1.  Nut

  Nut <ftp:\\ftp.metalab.unc.edu\pub\Linux\apps\misc\> allows you to
  record what you eat and analyze your meals for nutrient composition.
  The database included is the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard
  Reference, Release 13, which contains 6,210 foods.

  This database of food composition tables contains values for calories,
  protein, carbohydrates, fiber, total fat, saturated fat,
  monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol; vitamins A,
  thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, B6, folate, B12, C, and
  E; and minerals calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese,
  phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, and zinc. Nutrient levels are
  expressed as a percentage of the Daily Values, the familiar standard
  of food labeling in the United States. In addition, levels of the
  omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are shown, along with
  average grams per day of the important PUFAs.

  You may search this list of foods and view nutrient values for
  different serving sizes; you may also rank foods in order of level of
  a particular nutrient. You may change the daily calorie level to
  correspond to your personal metabolism, and the levels for fat,
  carbohydrates, and fiber are automatically adjusted. You may add your
  own recipes to the database, by creating them from the foods in the
  database.


  4.2.  Bicycle Ride Calorie Calculator

  Bicycle Ride Calorie Calculator
  <http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/6434/calcalc.html> by
  Greg Kondrasuk is a simple program that calculates the number of
  calories expended on a bicycle ride. It is based on an article in the
  May 1989 issue of Bicycling Magazine, pp. 100-103. It provides a good
  estimate of the number of calories burned based on time, distance,
  rider weight, wind speed and direction, drafting, and climbing.


  4.3.  weight

  weight <http://world.std.com/~damned/software.html> is a GPL program,
  which helps users keep track of their weight. It computes a moving
  weighted average based upon daily weight (useful because it smooths
  the fluctuation of daily weights), can compute caloric debt, and can
  plot monthly, quarterly, annual, and other graphs of weight.


  5.  Other Resources



  5.1.  LinuxMedNews

  LinuxMedNews <http://www.LinuxMedNews.org/> is a site designed to
  facilitate, amplify and begin the process of fundamentally changing
  medical education and practice into a more effective, fair and humane
  enterprise using modern technologies. The site uses Zope and a
  slashdot clone Squishdot to accomplish these goals. It is not intended
  to be doctor-centric, it is intended to be an interesting/fun forum
  and resource for anyone who has an interest in health care and open
  source.

  uses MySQL as its database. It aims to provide the veterinarian with a
  complete solution for running a clinic, small or large.


  7.  Miscellaneous



  7.1.  Data Collection

  An increasing role in data collection for instance in hospitals, will
  be played by handheld computers (HPCs) or Personal Digital Assistants
  (PDAs). More commonly known as PALMs. Linux offers way to exchange
  these data to servers, for instance via the IrDA port. See IR-HOWTO
  <http://mobilix.org/howtos.html> for details. A survey of non-Linux
  applications for the Palm device you may find at PalmPilot Medical -
