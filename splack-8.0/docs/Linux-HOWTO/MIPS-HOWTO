  1.  What is Linux/MIPS?

  Linux/MIPS is a port of the widespread UNIX clone Linux to the MIPS
  architecture.  Linux/MIPS is running on a large number of technically
  very different systems ranging from small embedded systems and servers
  to large desktop machines and servers that, at least at the time when
  they were introduced into the market, were the best of their class.


  Linux/MIPS advantages over other operating systems at this time are

  ·  The entire Linux system consists only of Free Software.

  ·  Excellent Price/Performance ratio.

  ·  Availability of large amounts of software of which a large part
     again is Free Software.

  ·  Binary compatibility across a growing number of platforms.

  ·  Small footprint making Linux/MIPS suitable for many embedded
     systems.

  In short, Linux has been designed and ships with Fahrvergnügen.
  However, as usual your mileage may vary and you should examine the
  suitability of Linux for your task - something which we hope this
  document helps you to accomplish.

  3.  What hardware does Linux/MIPS support?

  3.1.  Hardware Platforms


  Many machines are available with a number of different CPU options of
  which not all are currently supported.  Please check section
  ``Processor Types'' to make sure your CPU type is supported.  This is
  a listing of machines that are running Linux/MIPS, systems to which
  Linux/MIPS could be ported, or systems that people have an interest in
  running Linux/MIPS.


  3.1.1.  Acer PICA

  The Acer PICA is derived from the Mips Magnum 4000 design.  It has a
  R4400PC CPU running at 133MHz or optionally 150MHz plus a 512KB
  (optionally 2MB) second level cache; the Magnum's G364 gfx card was
  replaced with a S3 968 based one.  The system is supported with the
  exception of the X server.


  3.1.2.  Baget/MIPS series

  The Baget series includes several boxes which have R3000 processors:
  Baget 23, Baget 63, and Baget 83.  Baget 23 and 63 have BT23-201 or
  BT23-202 motherboards with R3500A (which is basically a R3000A chip)
  at 25 MHz and R3081E at 50 MHz respectively.  The BT23-201 board has
  VME bus and VIC068, VAC068 chips as system controllers.  The BT23-202
  board has PCI as internal bus and VME as internal.  Support for
  BT23-201 board has been done by Gleb Raiko (rajko@mech.math.msu.su)
  and Vladimir Roganov (vroganov@msiu.ru) with a bit of help from
  Serguei Zimin (zimin@msiu.ru).  Support for BT23-202 is under
  development along with Baget 23B which consists of 3 BT23-201 boards
  with shared VME bus.


  Baget 83 is mentioned here for completeness only. It has only 2MB RAM
  and it's too small to run Linux.  The Baget/MIPS code has been merged
  with the DECstation port. The source for both is available at
  <http://decstation.unix-ag.org/>.


  3.1.3.  Cobalt Qube and Raq

  The Cobalt Qube product series are low cost headless server systems
  based on a IDT R5230.  Cobalt has developed its own Linux/MIPS variant
  to fit the special requirements of the Qube as well as possible.
  Basically, the Qube kernel was derived from Linux/MIPS 2.1.56,
  backported to 2.0.30 for stability's sake, then optimized.  Cobalt
  kernels are available from Cobalt's ftp site
  <http://www.cobaltnet.com>.  The Cobalt Qube support has never been
  integrated into the official Linux/MIPS 2.1.x kernels.


  3.1.4.  NEC machines

  The NEC uniprocessor machines are OEM Acer PICA systems, see that
  section for details.  The SMP systems are different from that.  The
  Linux/MIPS developers have no technical documentation as necessary to
  write an OS.  As long as that does not change, this will pretty much
  stay a show- stopper, preventing a port to NEC's SMP systems.


  3.1.5.  NEC VR41xx-based platforms

  The Linux VR project is porting Linux to devices based on the NEC
  VR41xx microprocessors.  Many of these devices were originally
  designed to run Windows CE.  The project has produced working kernels
  with basic drivers for the Vadem Clio, Casio E-105, Everex Freestyle,
  and more.  For more information please see  <http://linux-vr.org/>.


  3.1.6.  Toshiba TMPR39xx/Philips PR31700 platforms

  Similar to the VR41xx, devices with these processors were originally
  intended for running Windows CE. However, there are working kernels
  with basic drivers for Sharp Mobilon and the Compaq C-Series. Support
  for more devices is under construction. The code is part of the Linux
  VR project and as such more information can be found at
  <http://linux-vr.org/>.


  3.1.7.  Netpower 100

  The Netpower 100 is apparently an Acer PICA in disguise.  It should
  therefore be supported but this is untested.  If there is a problem
  then it is probably the machine detection.


  3.1.8.  Nintendo 64

  The Nintendo 64 is R4300-based game console with 4MB RAM.  Its
  graphics chips were developed by Silicon Graphics for Nintendo.  Right
  now this port has pipe dream status and will continue to be in that
  state until Nintendo decides to publish the necessary technical
  information.  The question remains as to whether porting the
  Linux/MIPS code to this platform is a good idea.


  3.1.9.  Silicon Graphics Challenge S

  This machine is very similar to the Indy, the differences are that it
  doesn't have a keyboard or graphics card, but has an additional SCSI
  WD33C95-based adapter.  This WD33C95 hostadapter is currently not
  supported.


  3.1.10.  Silicon Graphics Indigo

  This machine is only being mentioned here because people have
  occasionally confused it with Indys or the Indigo 2.  The Indigo is a
  different R3000-based architecture however, and is not yet
  unsupported.


  3.1.11.  Silicon Graphics Indigo2

  This machine is the successor to the Indigo and is very similar to the
  Indy.  It is now supported, but is lacking in several areas. You will
  have to use serial console. If you have an Indigo2 and still want to
  run Linux on it, contact either Florian Lohoff (flo@rfc822.org) or
  Klaus Naumann (spock@mgnet.de) .


  3.1.12.  Silicon Graphics Indy

  The Indy is currently the only (mostly) supported Silicon Graphics
  machine.  The only supported graphics card is the Newport card, a.k.a.
  ``XL'' graphics.  The Indy is available with a large number of CPU
  options at various clock rates, all of which are supported.  There is
  also a X server available, now written by Guido Guenther
  (guido.guenther@gmx.net).  If you're able to use the Newport console
  on your Indy it should be possible to also use this X server. It's
  based on XFree86 4.0 and currently runs at snail-like speeds, but it
  seems to work quite well.  If you want to try it, take a look at
  <http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/mipslinux/x/> .


  3.1.12.1.  Strange amounts of available memory

  On bootup, the kernel on the Indy will report available memory with a
  message like:

     Memory: 27976k/163372k available (1220k kernel code, 2324k data)



  The large difference between the first pair of numbers is caused by a
  128MB area in the Indy's memory address space which mirrors up to the
  first 128MB of memory.  The difference between the two numbers will
  always be about 128MB and does not indicate a problem of any kind.
  Kernels since 2.3.23 don't count this 128MB gap any more.


  3.1.12.2.  Indy PROM related problems

  Several people have reported these problems with their machines after
  upgrading them typically from surplus parts.  There are several PROM
  versions for the Indy available.  Machines with old PROM versions
  which have been upgraded to newer CPU variants, like a R4600SC or
  R5000SC module, can crash during the self test with an error message
  like:

     Exception: <vector=Normal>
     Status register: 0x30004803<CU1,CU0,IM7,IM4,IPL=???,MODE=KERNEL,EXL,IE>
     Cause register: 0x4000<CE=0,IP7,EXC=INT>
     Exception PC: 0xbfc0b598
     Interrupt exception
     CPU Parity Error Interrupt
     Local I/O interrupt register 1: 0x80 <VR/GIO2>
     CPU parity error register: 0x80b<B0,B1,B3,SYSAD_PAR>
     CPU parity error: address: 0x1fc0b598
     NESTED EXCEPTION #1 at EPC: 9fc3df00; first exception at PC: bfc0b598



  In that case, you'll have to upgrade your machine's PROM to a newer
  version, or go back to an older CPU version (usually R4000SC or
  R4400SC modules should work).  Just to be clear, this is a problem
  which is unrelated to Linux, it is only mentioned here because several
  Linux users have asked about it.



  3.1.12.3.  ELF support in old PROM versions

  Old PROM versions don't know about the ELF binary format which the
  Linux kernel uses, so Linux cannot boot directly.  The preferable
  solution for this is of course a PROM upgrade.  Alternatively, you can
  use Sash for IRIX 5 or newer to boot the kernel.  Sash knows how to
  load ELF binaries and doesn't care if it's an IRIX or Linux kernel.
  Simply type ``Sash'' to the PROM monitor.  You should get another
  shell prompt, this time from Sash.  Now launch Linux as usual.

  Sash can read EFS or XFS filesystems or read the kernel from bootp /
  tftp.  That means if you intend to use Sash for booting the kernel
  from local disk, you'll still have to have a minimal IRIX installation
  on your system.


  3.1.12.4.  Why is so much memory reserved on my Indy?

  On bootup, the `Memory: ...' message on an Indy says that there is
  128MB of RAM reserved.  That is ok. Just like the PC architecture has
  a gap in its memory address space between 640KB and 1024KB, the Indy
  has a 128MB-sized area in its memory map where the first 128MB of its
  memory is mirrored.  Linux knows about it and just ignores that
  memory, and thus this message.



  3.1.13.  Silicon Graphics Origin 200 and 2000

  Ralf Bächle (ralf@gnu.org) and a team of SGI employees are currently
  working on a port to the Origin 200.  While still in it's early
  stages, it's running in uniprocessor and multiprocessor mode and has
  drivers for the built-in IOC3 Ethernet and SCSI hostadapters.  The
  code is available in the Linux/MIPS CVS tree.



  3.1.14.  Silicon Graphics Onyx 2

  The Onyx 2 is basically an Origin 2000 with additional graphics
  hardware.  As of now, writing Linux support for the graphics hardware
  has not yet been done.  Aside from that, Linux should run just as well
  as on a normal, headless Origin 2000 configuration.



  3.1.15.  Silicon Graphics Power Series

  This is a very old series of R3000 SMP systems.  There is no hardware
  documentation for these machines, few of them even exist anymore, and
  the hardware is weird.  In short, the chances that Linux will ever run
  on them are approximating zero.  Not that we want to discourage any
  takers ...


  3.1.16.  Serial console on SGI machines

  Make sure that the kernel you're using includes the appropriate driver
  for a serial interface and serial console.  Set the console ARC
  environment variable to either the value d1, or d2 for Indy and
  Challenge S depending on which serial interface you're going to use as
  the console.


  If you have the problem that all kernel messages appear on the serial
  console on boot-up, but everything is missing from the point when init
  starts, then you probably have the wrong setup for your /dev/console.
  You can find more information about this in the Linux kernel source
  documentation which is in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/serial-
  console.txt if you have the kernel source installed.


  3.1.17.  Other Silicon Graphics machines

  At this time, no other Silicon Graphics machine is supported.  This
  also applies to the very old Motorola 68k-based systems.


  3.1.18.  Sony Playstation

  The Sony Playstation is based on an R3000 derivative and uses a set of
  graphics chips developed by Sony themselves.  While the machine, in
  theory, is capable of running Linux, a port is difficult since Sony so
  far hasn't provided the necessary technical information.  This still
  leaves the question of whether the port would be worthwhile.  So in
  short, nothing has happened yet even though many people have shown an
  interest in running Linux on this system.


  3.1.19.  SNI RM200C

  In contrast to the RM200 (see below), this machine has EISA and PCI
  slots.  The RM200 is supported with the exception of the availability
  of the onboard NCR53c810A SCSI controller.


  3.1.20.  SNI RM200

  If your machine has both EISA and PCI slots, then it is an RM200C
  (please see above).  Due to the slight architectural differences of
  the RM200 and the RM200C, this machine isn't currently supported in
  the official sources.  Michael Engel (engel@numerik.math.uni-
  siegen.de) has managed to get his RM200 working partially, but the
  patches haven't yet been included in the official Linux/MIPS sources.



  3.1.21.  SNI RM300C

  The RM300 is technically very similar to the RM200C.  It should be
  supported by the current Linux kernel, but we haven't yet received any
  reports.


  3.1.22.  SNI RM400

  The RM400 isn't supported.


  3.1.23.  SNI RW320

  This machine is a OEM variant of the SGI Indigo and therefore also
  unsupported.


  3.1.24.  Algorithmics P-4032, P-5064, P-6032

  Algorithmics ( <http://www.algor.co.uk/>) make a series of single-
  board computers for MIPS prototyping, and maintain Linux kernels for
  all of them:

  ·  P-6032 is a new board for CPUs with 32-bit buses (QED RM5231, NEC
     Vr43x0, NEC Vr5432, IDT 64x74)

  ·  P-4032 is an older board obsoleted by P-6032.

  ·  P-5064 is for CPUs with 64-bit buses, notably QED's RM70xx and
     RM52xx series.

  All the boards have common I/O plus ethernet and disk interfaces
  onboard, with spare PCI slots for adding different controllers.
  They're highly configurable, so will run with either byte order.  All
  are suitable targets for 64-bit kernels, but (so far) all the Linux
  work we've done has been using 32-bit code.

  They're available, supported and documented with PDF manuals available
  online, like  <http://www.algor.co.uk/ftp/pub/doc/p6032-user.pdf> for
  the P-6032.

  At the time of writing (November 2000) we are using a 2.2.x kernel;
  kernel code is shared with the ports being done by people from MIPS
  Technologies, Inc.).  Algorithmics wrote the floating point trap
  handler and emulator used in this kernel - essential for MIPS CPUs to
  run floating point operations reliably and correctly.

  Algorithmics' kernels and a link to the MIPS userland can be found
  from a jump page at  <http://www.algor.co.uk/algor/info/linux.html>

  You can contact us at Algorithmics.


  3.1.25.  DECstation series

  During the late 80's and the early 90's, Digital (now Compaq) built
  MIPS-based Workstations named DECstation resp. DECsystem. Other x86
  and Alpha-based machines were sold under the name DECstation, but
  these are obviously not the subject of this FAQ. Support for
  DECstations is still under development, started by Paul M. Antoine.
  These days, most of the work is done by Harald Koerfgen
  (Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de) and others. On the Internet, DECstation-
  related information can be found at <http://decstation.unix-ag.org/>.


  The DECstation family ranges from the DECstation 2100 with an
  R2000/R2010 chipset at 12 MHz, to the DECstation 5000/260 with a 60
  MHz R4400SC.

  The following DECstation models are actively supported:

  ·  2100, codename PMAX

  ·  5000/xx (Personal DECstation), codename MAXine

  ·  5000/1xx, codename 3MIN

  ·  5000/200, codename 3MAX

  ·  5000/2x0, codename 3MAX+

  ·  5900/2x0 (identical to the 3MAX+).


  These DECstation models are orphaned because nobody is working on
  them, but support for them should be relatively easy to achieve.

  ·  3100, identical to the 2100 except the R2000A/R2010A @ 16 MHz

  ·  5100, codename MIPSMATE, almost identical to the 2100 but with an
     R3000/R3010 chipset.

  The other members of the DECstation family, besides the x86 based
  ones, should be considered as VAXen with the CPU replaced by a MIPS
  CPU.  There is absolutely no information available about these
  machines and support for them is unlikely to ever happen unless the
  VAXLinux port comes back to life. These are:

  ·  5400, codename MIPSFAIR

  ·  5500, codename MIPSFAIR2

  ·  5800, codename ISIS



  3.1.26.  Mips Magnum 4000 / Olivetti M700-10

  These two machines are almost completely identical.  Back during the
  ACE initiative, Olivetti licensed the Jazz design and marketed the
  machine with Windows NT as the OS.  MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. bought
  the Jazz design and marketed it as the MIPS Magnum 4000 series of
  machines.  Magnum 4000 systems were marketed with Windows NT and
  RISC/os as the operating systems.


  The firmware on the machine depended on the operating system which was
  installed.  Linux/MIPS supports only the little endian firmware on
  these two types of machines.  Since the M700-10 was only marketed as
  an NT machine, all M700-10 machines have this firmware installed.  The
  MIPS Magnum case is somewhat more complex.  If your machine has been
  configured big endian for RISC/os, then you need to reload the little
  endian firmware.  This firmware was originally included on a floppy
  with the delivery of every Magnum.  If you don't have the floppy
  anymore you can download it via anonymous ftp from
  <ftp://ftp.fnet.fr>.


  It is possible to reconfigure the M700 for headless operation by
  setting the firmware environment variables ConsoleIn and ConsoleOut to
  multi()serial(0)term().  Also, try the command listdev which will show
  the available ARC devices.

  In some cases, like where the G364 graphics card is missing but the
  console is still configured to use normal graphics, it will be
  necessary to set the configuration jumper JP2 on the board.  After the
  next reset, the machine will reboot with the console on COM2.


  3.1.27.  MIPS Magnum 4000SC

  The MIPS Magnum 4000SC is the same as a Magnum 4000 (see above) with
  the exception that it uses an R4000SC CPU.


  3.2.


  Processor types

  3.2.1.  R2000, R3000 family

  The R2000 is the original MIPS processor.  It's a 32 bit processor
  which was clocked at 8MHz back in '85 when the first MIPS processors
  came to the market.  Later versions were clocked faster, for example,
  the R3000 is a 100% compatible redesign of the R2000 which is just
  clocked faster.  Because of their high compatibility, where this
  document mentions the R3000, in most cases the same facts also apply
  to the R2000.  The R3000A is basically an R2000, plus an R3010 FPU,
  and 64K cache running at up to 40MHz all integrated onto the same
  chip.


  Harald Koerfgen (Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de) and Gleb O. Raiko
  (raiko@niisi.msk.ru) have both independently worked on patches for
  R3000 processors.  The work has been merged and integrated into the
  official Linux/MIPS sources since July 1999. Actually, Linux supports
  R3000 processors including some derivatives like the R3081 and the
  TMPR3912/PR31700



  3.2.2.  R6000

  Sometimes people confuse the R6000, a MIPS processor, with RS6000, a
  series of workstations made by IBM.  So, if you're reading this in
  hope of finding out more about Linux on IBM machines, then you're
  reading the wrong document.


  The R6000 is currently not supported.  It is a 32-bit MIPS ISA 2
  processor; a pretty interesting and weird piece of silicon.  It was
  developed and produced by a company named BIT Technology.  Later, NEC
  took over the semiconductor production.  It was built using ECL
  technology, the same technology that was, and still is, being used to
  build extremely fast chips like those used in some Cray computers.
  The processor had its TLB implemented as part of the last couple of
  lines of the external primary cache, a technology called TLB slice.
  That means its MMU is substantially different from those of the R3000
  or R4000 series, which is also one of the reasons why the processor
  isn't supported.


  3.2.3.  R4000 and R5000 family

  Linux supports many of the members of the R4000 family.  Currently,
  these are: R4000PC, R4400PC, R4300, R4600, R4700, R5000, R5230, R5260.
  Many others are probably supported as well.


  Not supported are the R4000MC and R4400MC CPUs (that is multiprocessor
  systems), as well as R5000 systems with a CPU-controlled second level
  cache.  This means that the cache is controlled by the R5000 itself,
  in contrast to some external cache controller.  The difference is
  important because, unlike other systems, especially PCs, on MIPS the
  cache is architecturally visible and needs to be controlled by
  software.

  Special credit goes to Ulf Carlsson (ulfc@engr.sgi.com) who provided
  the CPU module for debugging the R4000SC / R4400SC support.


  3.2.4.  R8000

  The R8000 is currently unsupported partly because this processor is
  relatively rare and has only been used in a few SGI machines, and
  partly because the Linux/MIPS developers don't have such a machine.

  The R8000 is a pretty interesting piece of silicon.  Unlike the other
  members of the MIPS family it is a set of seven chips.  It's cache and
  TLB architecture are pretty different from the other members of the
  MIPS family.  It was born as a quick hack to get the floating point
  crown back to Silicon Graphics before the R10000 is finished.


  3.2.5.  R10000

  The R10000 is supported as part of the mips64 kernel which currently
  is supported on the IP22 (SGI Indy, Challenge S and Indigo 2) and
  Origin.

  Due to the very hard-to-handle way this processor works in non-
  cachecoherent systems, it will probably be some time until we support
  this processor in such systems.  As of today, these systems are the
  SGI O2 and Indigo



  3.2.6.  Processors without TLB

  For embedded purposes, there are special derivates of the above CPU
  available which often lack a full TLB.  We don't support those types
  nor should you ever expect such support to be added.


  Hackers may want to take a look at a Linux subset named
  Microcontroller Linux, or short, ucLinux.  This would be supportable
  on TLB-less processors.  Given the litte difference between CPU types
  with and without TLB, we still recommend that you choose a processor
  with TLB.  It's going to save you a lot of engineering.


  3.2.7.  Processors with partial or no FPU

  In theory, these processors are supportable, especially when
  applications don't rely on the presence of a FPU.  We, however, don't
  support that yet.


  3.3.  Hardware we're never going to support



  3.3.1.  IBM RS6000

  As the name says, these are IBM machines which are based on the RS6000
  processor series, and, as such, they're not the subject of the
  Linux/MIPS project.  People frequently confuse the IBM RS6000 with the
  MIPS R6000 architecture.  However, the Linux/PPC project might support
  these machines.  Checkout <http://www.linuxppc.org/> for further
  information.


  3.3.2.  VaxStation

  As the name already implies, this machine is a member of Digital
  Equipment's VAX family.  It's mentioned here because people often
  confuse it with Digital's MIPS-based DECstation family due to the
  similar type numbers. These two families of architectures share little
  technical similarities.  Unfortunately, the VaxStation, like the
  entire VAX family, is currently unsupported.


  3.3.3.  SGI VisPC

  This is actually an x86-based system, therefore not covered by this
  FAQ.  There is some limited Linux support available for the older
  Visual Workstations.  The current series of Visual Workstations is an
  officially supported SGI product. Please see  <http://oss.sgi.com> and
  <http://www.sgi.com> for more information.


  3.3.4.  Motorola 68k-based machines like the Iris 3000

  These are very old machines, probably more than ten years old by now.
  As these machines are not based on MIPS processors, and therefore not
  supported by the Linux/MIPS project, this document is the wrong place
  to search for information.


  4.  Linux distributions.


  4.1.  RedHat

  For MIPSeb, there's Rough Cuts Linux, previously known as Hard Hat
  Linux, which is most of RedHat Linux 5.1 ported for MIPSeb.  You can
  get this at <ftp://oss.sgi.com/pub/linux/mips/redhat>.


  It is bundled along with M68k, UltraSparc, and PowerPC in a package
  called "Rough Cuts" pressed by RedHat, and available wherever RedHat
  products are sold.  This is a very convenient way to get it without
  having to download 280MB.  Redhat is no longer offering this product
  but if you're lucky you may still find the CD in some shops or
  somewhere on the net.

  A distribution based on Red Hat 5.2 that's targeting the Cobalt Qubes.
  Those binaries will work perfectly on other MIPSel architectures and
  are available at  <ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel>.
  <ftp://bolug.uni-bonn.de/mips> has various rpm packages from
  Redhat 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2.


  4.2.  Debian

  A Debian port is underway.  Current efforts are being bootstrapped
  using SGI/Linux as a base, and dpkg compiles natively with few
  changes.  In addition to the SGI version, some interest has been shown
  in little endian platforms.  Keep an eye on the Debian-MIPS Port page,
  <http://www.debian.org/ports/mips/> for developments.


  4.3.  Simple

  This distribution is for big-endian systems only so far. It's highly
  experimental, intended for developers' use in testing the latest
  versions of gcc, binutils, glibc, and the kernel. This is the only
  glibc 2.2-based distribution available for MIPS. You can always get
  the latest version of this distribution and accompanying release notes
  at  <ftp://oss.sgi.com/pub/linux/mips/mips-linux/simple>. Also
  available is a cross-compiler system to aid in development.


  4.4.  Other

  Kevin Kissel of MIPS, Inc. has put together a compilation of the
  RedHat 5.2 mipsel distribution that includes the all the packages from
  the Cleveland LUG site <ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel>,
  plus quite a few others from elsewhere that are either newer than, or
  missing from, the Cleveland LUG distribution.  This compilation can be
  found via HTML at <http://www.paralogos.com/mipslinux> or directly by
  FTP at <ftp://ftp.paralogos.com/pub/linux/mips/RPMS/mipsel>.



  5.  Linux/MIPS net resources.


  5.1.  Anonymous FTP servers.

  The two primary anonymous FTP servers for Linux/MIPS are

     oss.sgi.com
        This server should satisfy almost all of your Linux/MIPS related
        ftp desires.  Really.


     ftp.fnet.fr
        This server is currently pretty outdated. It's included here
        mostly for completeness, and for people with interest in
        prehistoric software.

  On all of these ftp servers, there is a list of mirror sites you may
  want to use for faster access.


  Another source for little endian MIPS binaries is
  ftp://intel.cleveland.lug.net/pub/Mipsel, which carries mostly newer
  versions of binaries for the RedHat flavour shipping with the Cobalts.



  5.2.  Anonymous CVS servers.

  For those who always want to stay on the bleeding edge, and want to
  avoid having to download patch files or full tarballs, we also have an
  anonymous CVS server.  Using CVS, you can checkout the Linux/MIPS
  source tree with the following commands:



     cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs login
     (Only needed the first time you use anonymous CVS, the password is "cvs")
     cvs -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs co <repository>



  where you insert linux, libc, gdb or faq for <repository>.

  The other important CVS archive of the Linux community is
  vger.kernel.org, where a lot of code is being collected before being
  sent to Linus for distribution.  Although vger itself no longer offers
  anonymous access, there are mirror sites which do provide anonymous
  access.  For details on how to access them, see
  <http://cvs.on.openprojects.net/>.  The modules which are of interest
  are: ``linux'', ``modutils'', ``pciutils'', and ``netutils''.


  5.3.  Web servers.

  The two primary web servers for Linux/MIPS are

      <http://oss.sgi.com/mips>
        This server covers most of Linux/MIPS. It's somewhat SGI-
        centric, but since Linux/MIPS tries to be the same on every
        platform, most of its information is of interest to all users.

      <http://www.linux-mips.org>
        Quite new site which one day will hopefully become the main
        Linux/MIPS site.

      <http://lena.fnet.fr>
        This server is currently pretty outdated. It's included here
        mostly for completeness.

  All of these servers have mirrors scattered all over the world - you
  may want to use one for best performance.


  5.4.  Web CVS server.

  Via  <http://oss.sgi.com/mips/cvsweb>, you have direct access to the
  new Linux/MIPS kernel sources, and a few other projects hosted in the
  same CVS archive.  The intuitive interface allows you to follow the
  development at the click of your mouse.


  5.5.  Mailing lists.

  There are three Linux/MIPS-oriented mailing lists:

     linux-mips@fnet.fr
        This mailing list is used for most all non-SGI related
        communication.  Subscription is handled by a human, and you can
        send your subscription requests to linux-mips-request@fnet.fr.
        You can unsubscribe from this mailing list by sending
        unsubscribe <your-email-address> to the same address. Only
        subscribers are allowed to post to this list.


     linux-mips@oss.sgi.com
        This mailing list currently has the most traffic.  It's somewhat
        SGI-centric but is nevertheless of interest especially to
        developers as a good number of SGI engineers are subscribed to
        this list.  Subscription to this list is handled via Majordomo
        (majordomo@oss.sgi.com), just send an email with the words
        subscribe linux-mips.  In order to unsubscribe, send unsubscribe
        linux-mips.  For more, information see also
        <http://oss.sgi.com/mips/email.html>.


  5.6.  IRC channel.

  There is an IRC channel named #mipslinux for Linux/MIPS which may be
  found on irc.openprojects.net.


  6.  Installation of Linux/MIPS and common problems.



  6.1.  NFS booting fails.

  Usually, the reason for this is that people have unpacked the tar
  archive under IRIX, not Linux.  Since the representation of device
  files over NFS is not standardized between various Unices, this fails.
  The symptom is that the system dies with the error message ``Warning:
  unable to open an initial console.'' right after mounting the NFS
  filesystem.


  For now, the workaround is to use a Linux system (doesn't need to be
  MIPS) to unpack the installation archive onto the NFS server.  The NFS
  server itself may be any type of UNIX.



  6.2.  Self-compiled kernels crash when booting.

  When I build my own kernel, it crashes.  On an Indy the crash message
  looks like the following (the same problem hits other machines as well
  but may look completely different):


     Exception: <vector=UTLB Miss>
     Status register: 0x300004803<CU1,CU0,IM4,IPL=???,MODE=KERNEL,EXL,IE>

       gp 881dfd90 fp 9fc4be88 sp 8bfff8b8 ra 88002614

     PANIC: Unexpected exception



  This problem is caused by a still unfixed bug in Binutils newer than
  version 2.7.  As a workaround, change the following line in
  arch/mips/Makefile from:


     LINKFLAGS       = -static -N



  to:


     LINKFLAGS       = -static



  6.3.  Booting the kernel on the Indy fails with PROM error messages


     >> boot bootp()/vmlinux
     73264+592+11520+331680+27848d+3628+5792 entry: 0x8df9a960
     Setting $netaddres to 192.168.1.5 (from server deadmoon)
     Obtaining /vmlinux from server deadmoon

     Cannot load bootp()/vmlinux
     Illegal f_magic number 0x7f45, expected MIPSELMAGIC or MIPSEBMAGIC.



  This problem only happens for Indys with very old PROM versions which
  cannot handle the ELF binary format which Linux uses.  A solution for
  this problem is in the works.


  6.4.  Where can I get the little endian firmware for my SNI?


  SNI's system can be operated in both big and little endian modes.  At
  this time, Linux/MIPS only supports the little endian firmware.  This
  is somewhat unlucky since SNI hasn't shipped that firmware for quite
  some time, since they dropped Windows NT.

  When running in big endian mode, the firmware looks similar to an SGI
  Indy which is already supported, therefore fixing the SNI support will
  be relatively easy.  Interested hackers should contact Ralf Bächle
  (ralf@gnu.org).


  6.5.  ld dies with signal 6


     collect2: ld terminated with signal 6 [Aborted]



  This is a known bug in older binutils versions.  You will have to
  upgrade to binutils 2.8.1 plus very current patches.


  6.6.  My machine doesn't download the kernel when I try to netboot


  Your machine is replying to the BOOTP packets (you may verify this
  using a packet sniffer like tcpdump or ethereal), but doesn't download
  the kernel from your BOOTP server. This happens if your boot server is
  running a kernel of the 2.3 series or higher. The problem may be
  circumvented by doing a "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc"
  as root on your boot server.



  6.7.  Bug in DHCP version 2

  When using DHCP version 2 you might see the following problem: Your
  machines receives it's BOOTP reply 3 times but refuses to start TFTP.
  You can fix this by doing a "unsetenv netaddr" in the PROM command
  monitor before you boot your system. DHCP version 3 fixes that
  problem.


  7.  Milo

  Milo is the boot loader used to boot the little endian MIPS systems
  with ARC firmware, currently the Jazz family and the SNI RM 200.
  While Milo uses the same name and has a similar purpose to the Alpha
  version of Milo, these two Milos have nothing else in common.  They
  were developed by different people, don't share any code, and work on
  different hardware platforms.  The fact that both have the same name
  is just a kind of historic ``accident''.

  Plans are to remove the need for Milo in the near future.



  7.1.  Building Milo

  The building procedure of Milo is described, in detail, in the README
  files in the Milo package.  Since Milo has some dependencies to kernel
  header files which have changed over time, Milo often cannot be built
  easily.  However, the Milo distribution includes binaries for both
  Milo and Pandora.


  7.2.  Pandora

  Pandora is a simple debugger which was primarily developed in order to
  analyze undocumented systems.  Pandora includes a disassembler, memory
  dump functions, and more.  If you only want to use Linux, then there
  is no need to install Pandora, despite its small size.


  8.  Loadable Modules

  Using modules on Linux/MIPS is quite easy. It should work as expected
  for people who have used the feature on other Linux systems.  If you
  want to run a module-based system, then you should have at least
  kernel version 980919, and modutils newer than version 2.1.121
  installed.  Older versions won't work.


  9.  How do I set up a cross-compiler?


  9.1.  Available binaries

  The easiest way to setup a cross-compiler is to just download the
  binaries.  For Linux/i386 hosts and big endian targets, these are the
  packages:

    binutils-mips-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
    egcs-c++-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-g77-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-libstdc++-mips-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-objc-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm


  And this is the list of packages for little endian targets:

    binutils-mipsel-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
    egcs-c++-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-g77-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-libstdc++-mipsel-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
    egcs-objc-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm



  For 64-bit MIPS kernels, there is only one package available right
  now:

    egcs-mips64-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm



  This compiler is only available in the big endian flavor as there
  currently is no little endian machine supported by the 64-bit kernel.
  A little endian version of the compiler will be provided as soon as
  there is demand for one.

  It's not necessary that you install all of these packages as most
  people can just omit the C++, Objective C and Fortran 77 compilers.
  The Intel binaries have been linked against GNU libc 2.1, so you may
  have to install that as well when upgrading.


  9.2.  Recommended compiler versions

  Compilers older than egcs 1.1.2 are no longer supported for compiling
  kernels due to bugs in the generated code.  At this time, we still
  recommend binutils 2.8.1 despite their age.


  9.3.  Building your own cross-compiler

  First of all, go and download the following source packages:

  ·  binutils-2.8.1.tar.gz

  ·  egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz

  ·  glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz

  ·  glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz

  ·  glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz

  ·  glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz

     You can obtain these files from your favorite GNU archive or
     oss.sgi.com.  Furthermore, you'll need patches.  The unbundled
     patch files aren't always up-to-date and addional, not MIPS-
     specific, patches may be required for building.  Note that the
     unbundled patch files also use a different revision numbering and
     it is therefore recommended that you obtain the source and patches
     from the RPM packages distributed on oss.sgi.com.

  Those are the currently recommended versions.  Older versions may or
  may not be working.  If you're trying to use older versions, please
  don't send bug reports because we don't care.  When installing, please
  install things in the order of binutils, egcs, then glibc.  Unless you
  have older versions already installed, changing the order will fail.


  9.4.  Disk space requirements

  For the installation, you'll have to choose a directory where the
  files will be installed. I'll refer to that directory below with
  <prefix>.  To avoid a particular problem, it's best to use the same
  value for <prefix> as your native gcc.  For example, if your gcc is
  installed in /usr/bin/gcc, then choose /usr for <prefix>.  You must
  use the same <prefix> value for all the packages that you're going to
  install.

  During compilation, you'll need about 31MB disk space for binutils.
  For installation, you'll need 7MB disk space on <prefix>'s partition.
  Building egcs requires 71MB, and installation 14MB.  GNU libc requires
  149MB disk space during compilation, and 33MB for installation.  Note,
  these numbers are just a guideline and may differ significantly for
  different processor and operating system architectures or compiler
  options.


  9.5.  Byte order

  One of the special features of the MIPS architecture is that all
  processors except the R8000 can be configured to run either in big or
  in little endian mode.  Byte order means the way the processor stores
  multibyte numbers in memory.  Big endian machines store the byte with
  the highest value digits at the lowest address while little endian
  machines store it at the highest address.  Think of it as writing
  multi-digit numbers from left to right or vice versa.

  In order to setup your cross-compiler correctly, you have to know the
  byte order of the cross-compiler target.  If you don't already know,
  check the section ``Hardware Platforms'' for your machine's byte
  order.


  9.6.  Configuration names

  Many of the packages based on autoconf support many different
  architectures and operating systems.  In order to differentiate
  between these many configurations, names are constructed with
  <cpu>-<company>-<os>, or even <cpu>-<company>-<kernel>-<os>.
  Expressed this way, the configuration names of Linux/MIPS are: mips-
  unknown-linux-gnu for big endian targets, or mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu
  for little endian targets.  These names are a bit long and are allowed
  to be abbreviated to mips-linux or mipsel-linux.  You must use the
  same configuration name for all packages that comprise your cross-
  compilation environment.  Also, while other names, like mips-sni-linux
  or mipsel-sni-linux, are legal configuration names, use mips-linux or
  mipsel-linux instead. These are the configuration names known to other
  packages, like the Linux kernel sources, and they would otherwise have
  to be changed for cross-compilation.

  I'll refer to the target configuration name below with <target>.


  9.7.  Installation of GNU Binutils.

  This is the first and simplest part (at least as long as you're trying
  to install on any halfway-sane UNIX flavour).  Just cd into a
  directory with enough free space and do the following:



     gzip -cd binutils-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
     cd binutils-<version>
     patch -p1 < ../binutils-<version>-mips.patch
     ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --target=<target>
     make CFLAGS=-O2
     make install



  This usually works correctly.  However, certain machines using GCC
  2.7.x as compiler are known to dump core.  This is a known bug in GCC
  and can be fixed by upgrading the host compiler to GCC 2.8.1 or bet­
  ter.


  9.8.  Assert.h

  Some people have an old assert.h header file installed, probably
  leftover from an old cross-compiler installation.  This file may cause
  autoconf scripts to fail silently. Assert.h was never necessary and
  was only installed because of a bug in older GCC versions.  Check to
  see if the file <prefix>/<target>/include/assert.h exists in your
  installation.  If so, just delete the it - it should never have been
  installed for any version of the cross-compiler and will cause
  trouble.


  9.9.  Installing the kernel sources

  Installing the kernel sources is simple.  Just place them into some
  directory of your choice and configure them.  Configuring them is
  necessary so that files which are generated by the procedure will be
  installed.  Make sure you enable CONFIG_CROSSCOMPILE near the end of
  the configuration process.  The only problem you may run into is that
  you may need to install some required GNU programs like bash or have
  to override the manufacturer-provided versions of programs by placing
  the GNU versions earlier in the PATH variable.  Now, go to the
  directory <prefix>/<target>/include and create two symbolic links
  named asm and linux pointing to include/asm rsp. include/linux within
  your just installed and configured kernel sources.  These are
  necessary such that the necessary header files will be found during
  the next step.


  9.10.  First installation of egcs

  Now the pain begins.  There is a so-called bootstrap problem.  In our
  case, this means that the installation process of egcs needs an
  already installed glibc, but we cannot compile glibc because we don't
  have a working cross-compiler yet.  Luckily, you'll only have to go
  through this once when you install a cross-compiler for the first
  time.  Later, when you already have glibc installed, things will be
  much smoother.  So now do:

     gzip -cd egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
     cd egcs-<version>
     patch -p1 < ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
     ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --with-newlib --target=<target>
     make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" ALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
             CONFIGURE_TARGET_MODULES= INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= LANGUAGES="c"



  Note that we deliberately don't build gcov, protoize, unprotoize, and
  the libraries.  Gcov doesn't make sense in a cross-compiler environ­
  ment, and protoize and unprotoize might even overwrite your native
  programs - this is a bug in the gcc makefiles.  Finally, we cannot
  build the libraries because we don't have glibc installed yet.  If
  everything went successfully, install with:

     make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
             LANGUAGES="c" install



  If you only want the cross-compiler for building the kernel, you're
  done.  Cross-compiling libc is only required to be able to compile
  user applications.


  9.11.  Test what you've done so far

  Just to make sure that what you've done so far is actually working,
  you may now try to compile the kernel.  Cd to the MIPS kernel's
  sources and type ``make clean; make dep; make''.  If everything went
  ok do ``make clean'' once more to clean the sources.


  9.12.  Installing GNU libc

  Note: Building glibc 2.0.6 using a compiler newer than egcs 1.0.3a is
  not recommended due to binary compatibility problems which may hit
  certain software.  It's recommended that you either use egcs 1.0.3a or
  use the files from a published binary package.  Crosscompiling GNU
  libc is always only the second best solution as certain parts of it
  will not be compiled when crosscompiling.  A proper solution will be
  documented here as soon as it is available and believed to be stable.
  With this warning given, here's the recipe:

     gzip -cd glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
     cd glibc-2.0.6
     gzip -cd glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
     gzip -cd glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
     gzip -cd glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
     patch -p1 < ../glibc-2.0.6-mips.patch
     mkdir build
     cd build
     CC=<target>-gcc BUILD_CC=gcc AR=<target>-ar RANLIB=<target>-ranlib \
           ../configure --prefix=/usr --host=<target> \
           --enable-add-ons=crypt,linuxthreads,localedata --enable-profile
     make



  You now have a compiled GNU libc which still needs to be installed.
  Do not just type make install.  That would overwrite your host sys­
  tem's files with Linux/MIPS-specific files with disastrous effects.
  Instead, install GNU libc into some other arbitrary directory
  <somedir> from which we'll move the parts we need for cross-compila­
  tion into the actual target directory:

     make install_root=<somedir> install



  Now cd into <somedir> and finally install GNU libc manually:



     cd usr/include
     find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/include
     cd ../../lib
     find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/lib
     cd ../usr/lib
     find . -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/<target>/lib



  GNU libc also contains extensive online documentation.  Your system
  might already have a version of this documentation installed, so if
  you don't want to install the info pages, which will save you a less
  than a megabyte, or already have them installed, skip the next step:

     cd ../info
     gzip -9 *.info*
     find . -name \*.info\* -print | cpio -pumd <prefix>/info



  If you're not bootstrapping, your installation is now finished.


  9.13.  Building egcs again

  The first attempt of building egcs was stopped by lack of a GNU libc.
  Since we now have libc installed we can rebuild egcs but this time as
  complete as a cross-compiler installation can be:

     gzip -cd egcs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
     cd egcs-<version>
     patch -p1 < ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
     ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --target=<target>
     make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77"



  As you can see, the procedure is the same as the first time, with the
  exception that we dropped the --with-newlib option.  This option was
  necessary to avoid the libgcc build breaking due to the lack of libc.
  Now install with:

     make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77" install



  You're almost finished.  If you think you don't need the Objective C
  or F77 compilers, you can omit them from above commands. Each will
  save you about 3MB.  Do not build gcov, protoize, or unprotoize.


  9.14.  Should I build the C++, Objective C or F77 compilers?

  The answer to this question largely depends on your use of your cross-
  compiler environment.  If you only intend to rebuild the Linux kernel,
  then you have no need for the full blown setup and can safely omit the
  Objective C and F77 compilers.  You must, however, build the C++
  compiler, because building the libraries included with the egcs
  distribution requires C++.


  9.15.  How about float.h?

  The installation of float.h is no longer necessary. Since about egcs
  1.0.3a, a proper float.h header file will automatically be generated
  and installed.
  9.16.  Known problem when cross-compiling


  9.16.1.  IRIX crashes

  Origin 200 running IRIX 6.5.1 may crash when running ``make depend''
  on the Linux kernel sources.  IRIX 6.5 on Indy and IRIX 6.5.4 on
  Origin 200 are known to work.  Further reports that help to isolate
  the problematic configuration are welcome.


  9.16.2.  Resource limits on System V based hosts

  Typical System V-based Unices, like IRIX or Solaris, have limits for
  the maximum number of arguments to be passed to a child process which
  may be exceeded when cross-compiling some software like the Linux
  kernel or GNU libc.  For IRIX systems, the maximum length of the
  argument list defaults to 20KB, while Linux defaults to at least
  128KB.  This size can be modified by the command ``systune ncargs
  131072'' as root.


  9.17.  GDB

  Building GDB as cross-debugger is only of interest to kernel
  developers. For them, GDB may be a life saver.  Such a remote
  debugging setup always consists of two parts:  the remote debugger GDB
  running on one machine, and the target machine running the Linux/MIPS
  kernel being debugged.  The machines are typically interconnected with
  a serial line.  The target machine's kernel needs to be equipped with
  a ``debugging stub'' which communicates with the GDB host machine
  using the remote serial protocol.


  Depending on the target's architecture, you may have to implement the
  debugging stub yourself.  In general, you'll only have to write very
  simple routines for the serial line.  The task is further simplified
  by the fact that most machines are using similar serial hardware,
  typically based on the 8250, 16450 or derivatives.



  10.  Related Literature


  10.1.  See MIPS Run

  Author Dominic Sweetman, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann, ISBN
  1-55860-410-3.

  This is intended as a pretty comprehensive guide to programming MIPS,
  wherever it's different from programming any other 32-bit CPU.  It's
  the first time anyone has tried to write a readable, and
  comprehensive, explanation and account of the wide range of MIPS CPUs
  available. It should be very helpful for anyone programming MIPS who
  isn't insulated by someone else's operating system.  Also, the author
  is a free-unix enthusiast who subscribes to the Linux/MIPS mailing
  list!

  John Hennessey, father of the MIPS architecture, was kind enough to
  write in the foreword: ``... this book is the best combination of
  completeness and readability of any book on the MIPS architecture
  ...'';


  It includes some context about RISC CPUs, a description of the
  architecture and instruction set, including the "co-processor 0"
  instructions used for CPU control; sections on caches, exceptions,
  memory management, and floating point.  There's a detailed assembly
  language guide, some stuff about porting, and some fairly heavy-duty
  software examples.

  and from good bookshops anywhere.  It's 512 pages and costs around $50
  in the US, £39.95 in the UK.

  I'd be inclined to list two other books too, both from Morgan Kaufmann
  and available from www.mkp.com or any good bookshop:


  10.2.  The MIPS Programmer's Handbook

  Authors Farquhar and Bunce, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann,
  ISBN 1-55860-297-6.

  A readable introduction to the practice of programming MIPS at the low
  level, by the author of PMON.  Strengths: lots of examples; weakness:
  leaves out some big pieces of the architecture (such as memory
  management, floating point and advanced caches) because they didn't
  feature in the LSI ``embedded'' products this book was meant to
  partner.


  10.3.  Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach

  Authors Hennessy & Patterson, Publisher Morgan Kaufmann,
  ISBN 1-55860-329-8.

  The bible of modern computer architecture and a must-read if you want
  to understand what makes programs run slow or fast.  Is it about MIPS?
  Well, it's mostly about something very like MIPS...  Its sole defect
  is its size and weight - but unlike most big books it's worth every
  page.


  10.4.  UNIX System V ABI MIPS Processor Supplement

  By Prentice Hall, Published 05/1991, ISBN 0-13880-170-3.  This book
  defines many of the MIPS specific technical standards like calling
  conventions, ELF properties, and much more that is being used by
  Linux/MIPS.  Unfortunately it's out of print.  Similarly, the site
  "http://www.mipsabi.org/" is offline.


  10.5.  The mips.com site
