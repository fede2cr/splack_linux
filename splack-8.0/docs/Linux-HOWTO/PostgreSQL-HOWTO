  This document is a "practical guide" to very quickly setup a SQL
  Database engine and front end tools on an Unix system. It also dis­
  cusses the International standard language ANSI/ISO SQL and reviews
  the merits/advantages of the SQL database engine developed by the
  world-wide internet in an "open development" environment.  It is about
  HOW-TO setup a next generation Object Relational SQL Database "Post­
  greSQL" on Unix system which can be used as an Application Database
  Server or as a Web Database Server. PostgreSQL attempts to implement
  current and future International ISO/ANSI SQL standards. This document
  also gives information on the database interface programs like Front
  End GUIs, RAD tools (Rapid Application Development), ODBC, JDBC
  drivers, "C", "C++", Java, Perl programming interfaces and Web
  Database Tools.  Information given here applies to all Unix/Windows NT
  platforms and to all other SQL databases. It will be very useful for
  people who are new to Databases, SQL language and PostgreSQL.  This
  document also has SQL tutorial, SQL syntax which would be very helpful
  for beginners. Experienced people will find this document as an useful
  reference guide. For students, the information given here will enable
  them to get the source code for PostgreSQL relational database system,
  from which they can learn as to how a RDBMS SQL database engine is
  created.

  1.  Introduction

  The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive list of
  pointers/URLs to quickly setup PostgreSQL and also to advocate the
  benefits of Open Source Code system like PostgreSQL, Linux.

  PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and not
  Postgre-es-cue-el.

  Each and every computer system in the world needs a database to
  store/retrieve the information.  The primary reason you use the
  computer is to store, retrieve and process information and do all
  these very quickly, thereby saving you time.  At the same time, the
  system must be simple, robust, fast, reliable, economical and very
  easy to use.  Database is the most VITAL SYSTEM as it stores mission
  critical information of every company in this world.  Each and every
  industry in this world needs a database system. Industries like
  telecom, automobile, banks, airlines, etc..  will not function
  efficiently without a database system.  The most popular database
  systems are based on the International Standard Organisation (ISO) SQL
  specifications and ANSI SQL (American) standards.  The current
  specifications widely used in the industry are ISO/ANSI SQL 1992.
  Upcoming standard is the SQL 1998/99 which is also called SQL-3 is
  still under development. Popular database like Oracle, Sybase and
  Informix systems are based on these standards or are trying to
  implement these standards.

  Without a standard like ANSI/ISO SQL, it would be very difficult for
  the customer to develop an application once and run on all the
  database systems.  End user wants to develop an application ONCE using
  ISO SQL, ODBC, JDBC and deploy on all variety of database systems in
  the world.

  The world's most popular FREE Database which implements some of the
  ISO SQL, ANSI SQL/98, SQL/92 and ANSI SQL/89 RDBMS is PostgreSQL.
  PostgreSQL is next generation Object relational database and is
  targeting on full compliance of SQL standards like ISO/ANSI SQL.
  PostgreSQL is the only free RDBMS in the world which supports Object
  databases and SQL. This document will tell you how-to install the
  database, how to set up the Web database, application database, front
  end GUIs and interface programs.  It is strongly advised that you MUST
  write your database applications 100 % compliant to standards of
  ISO/ANSI SQL, ODBC, JDBC so that your application is portable across
  multiple databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix etc.

  You get the highest quality, and lot many features with PostgreSQL as
  it follows 'Open Source Code development model'. Open Source Code
  model is the one where the complete source code is given to you and
  the development takes place on the internet by an extremely vast
  network of human brains.  Future trend shows that most of the software
  development will take place on the so called "Information Super-
  Highway" which spans the whole globe.  In the coming years, internet
  growth will be explosive which will further fuel rapid adoption of
  PostgreSQL by the industry.

  By applying the principles of statistics, mathematics and science to
  software quality, you get the best quality of software only in a 'Open
  Source Code System' like PostgreSQL, wherein the source code is open
  to a very vast number of human brains inter-connected by the
  information super-highway.  Greater the number of human brains
  working, the better will be the quality of software.  Open Source Code
  model will also prevent RE-INVENTION OF WHEELS, eliminates DUPLICATION
  OF WORK and will be very economical, saves time in distribution and
  follows the modern economic laws of optimizing the national and global
  resources.  Once a software work is done by others, then you DO NOT
  need to re-do that again. You will not be wasting your valuable time
  on something which had already been WELL DONE.  Your time is extremely
  precious and it must be utilized efficiently, because you have only 8
  hours a day for doing work.  As we will be entering the 21st century,
  there will be a change in the way that you get software for your use.
  Everybody will give first preference for the open source softwares
  like PostgreSQL, Linux.

  If you buy binaries, you will not get any equity and ownership of
  source code. Source code is a very valuable asset and binaries have no
  value. Buying software may become a thing of the past. You only need
  to buy good hardware, it is worth spending money on the hardware and
  get the software from internet. Important point is that it is the
  computer hardware which is doing bulk of the work.  Hardware is the
  real work horse and software is just driving it.  Computer hardware is
  so much more complex that only 6 nations in the world so far have
  demonstrated the capability of designing and manufacturing computer
  chips/hardware.  Design and manufacturing of computer chips is an
  advanced technology.  It is a very complex process, capital intensive,
  requires large investments in plant and production machines which deal
  with 0.18 micron (even smaller than 0.18) technology. On a single
  small silicon chip millions of transistors/circuits are densely
  packed.  Companies like Applied Material, AMD, Intel, Cyrix, Hitachi,
  IBM and others spent significant number of man-years to master the
  high-technology like Chip Design, Micro-electronics and Nano-
  electronics.  Micro means (one-millionth of meter 10^-6), Nano  means
  (one-billionth of meter 10^-9). Current technology uses micro-
  electronics of about 0.35 micron using aluminum as conductors and 0.25
  micron sizes using copper as conductors of electrons.  In near future
  the technology of 0.10 micron with copper and even nano-electronics
  will be used to make computer chips. Aluminum conductors will be
  phased out by copper on computer chips, as copper is a better
  conductor of electrons.  In photolithography process extreme
  ultraviolet, X-ray or electron-beam techniques will be used to etch
  circuits for feature size less than 0.15 micron.  In about 20 years
  from now, silicon chips will be phased out by molecular computers and
  bio chips which will be billions of times faster than silicon chips.
  Molecules are a group of atoms. And atoms are tiny particles which
  makes up everything that you see in this world. Molecular computers
  will use the molecules of matter as ultra-fast electronic on/off
  switches. When the switch is ON it indicates 1, and when it is OFF it
  indicates 0. All the computer programs in this world are based on
  binary (numbers 1 and 0).  Table below shows the progress and future
  advancement trends of computer chips.

  As you can see, it is hardware that is high technology and important
  and software is labor intensive but is a less difficult technology.

  On other hand, each and every country in the world develops/makes
  software.  In fact, any person in this world with a small low-cost PC
  can write software.

  Databases like Oracle, Informix, Sybase, IBM DB2 (Unix) are written
  using the "C" language and binaries are created by compiling the
  source code and then they are shipped out to customers. Oracle,
  Sybase, Informix databases are 100 % "C" programs!!
  Since a lot of work had been done on PostgreSQL for the past 14 years,
  it does not make sense to re-create from scratch another database
  system which satisfies ANSI/ISO SQL.  It will be a great advantage to
  take the existing code and add missing features or enhancements to
  PostgreSQL and start using it immediately.

  Prediction is that demand for "Internet products" like PostgreSQL will
  grow exponentially as it is capable of maintaining a high quality, low
  cost, extremely large user-base and developer-base. Those nations
  which do not use the 'Internet products' will be seriously missing
  "World-wide Internet Revolution" and will be left far behind other
  countries. The reason is "Internet" itself is the world's LARGEST
  "software company" and is a large software "power house"!

  1.1.  Quantum Computers - Quantum Physics Useful !!

  As you can see from above table "Advancement of chip capabilities in
  future" in the years after 2030, database systems like PostgreSQL will
  be running on Quantum Computers. Quantum Computers rely on an atomic
  particle's traits, such as direction of spin, for creating a state.
  For example, when the spin is up, a particle could be read as "one",
  when its spin is down, the  particle would be read as "zero". Atoms
  and nuclei can exist in a state of superposition, where the values of
  one, zero and the range in between can be represented concurrently. By
  entangling the spins of atoms, "qubits" can become wired together,
  enabling them to function as a collective whole, bringing about a
  nonlinear computational power that far surpasses the capabilities of
  supercomputers available today!! At atomic level Quantum Physics comes
  to assistance to better understand the behaviour of atomic particles.

  2.  Laws of Physics apply to Software!

  In this chapter, it will be shown how science plays an important role
  in the creation of various objects like software, this universe, mass,
  atoms, energy and even yourself!  This chapter also shows why
  knowledge of science is very important before you start using the
  products of science.

  The golden rule is - "You MUST not use a product without understanding
  how it is created!!" This rule applies to everything - database
  sytems, computer system, operating system, this universe and even your
  own human body! It means that you should have complete source code and
  information about the system. It is important to understand how human
  body and atoms inside human body works since humans are creating
  PostgreSQL, MS Windows95 etc..

  Creation is a very important step. Persons who are using the objects
  of science must know how it is created. This applies to even computer
  systems and PostgreSQL.  A majority of people do not have knowledge of
  science and hence do not know how systems like MS Windows NT/95,
  Oracle, human body and this universe are created. A vast majority of
  people do not know what made the universe and MS Windows 95/NT and
  what is inside it. Complex systems are built from very simple basic
  building blocks like - millions of universes are created, each
  universe in turn has millions of super-clusters, each super-cluster
  has millions of galaxies, each galaxy has millions of stars, some
  stars have many planets, each planet in turn is made up billions of
  atoms.(In the history of this world, only one universe was created by
  a man in ancient India eons ago, but no other case had been reported
  in the modern history. There is only one man-made universe) Creating
  an universe is a much more advanced technology and is more advanced
  than the atomic bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
  causing horrible destruction.  Modern nuclear weapons are so tiny and
  powerful that if such a single nuclear bomb is dropped in pacific
  ocean then it can completely vaporise the planet earth!  The total
  variety of weapons are infinity. There are weapons to even terminate
  the universes (it is not a good idea to give nuke weapons technology
  to every person). Nuclear weapons and other more powerful divine
  weapons were used in the battle field in ancient India! Nobody
  believed Albert Eienstein (a scientist of 1900's) when he said nuclear
  weapons can be made which can vaporise big cities.

  Software like MS Windows 95 is created simply by "C" and assembler
  language programs which simply uses 1 and 0 and universes like ours
  are created simply by dashing TWO dissimilar but proper of combination
  of tiny atomic particles of other dimensions.  (Something interesting
  happened just before dashing of tiny particles) A human body is
  created by dashing two dissimilar but proper combination of tiny
  cells!!  (Something interesting happened just before dashing of tiny
  cells) Humans inherited the properties of this universe.  The universe
  you are currently living in was NOT there - all the atoms inside the
  universe was not there and not even TIME was existing!! Baby universe
  was born during big bang and started expanding and kept growing. Even
  today our universe is still expanding and is not static!!  A person
  from another universe by name 'Brahma' created this universe you are
  currently living in.  Knowledge is the MOTHER of this universe!!  you
  are living was born!!  It is a deal similar to how you were born!
  Without any 'genes' from Mother Knowledge it is not possible create
  even a small "C" program!

  At some point our universe will close down (in a big crunch) and all
  the atoms inside the universe will completely vanish and dissappear!
  All the atoms that you see inside this universe will be gone!

  Total number of universes that can be created is INFINITY and
  similarly total number of operating systems that can be created is
  also infinity!! It is infinite cyclic process where universes are born
  and then later die down. There are millions of universes, which are
  classified into 3 major categories.  Infinite number universes and
  infinite variety of multi-dimensional atoms collapse down into few
  primary-dimensional-universe. And primary-dimensional universes
  collapse down into one single focus entity called 'eeshwar' (eeshara
  is a sanskrit word).  Very advanced mathematical equations support
  this theory.

  The laws of science and statistics favour the open-source code system
  like PostgreSQL and Linux.  As the internet speed is increasing
  everyday, and internet is becoming more and MORE reliable, the open-
  source code system will gain very rapid momentum.  And, if rules of
  statistics and laws of physics are correct, awareness of science grows
  and when IGNORANT people start learning science then the closed
  source-code systems will eventually vanish from this planet.

  Developing a project like PostgreSQL requires resources like energy
  and time, hence PostgreSQL is a product of energy and time.  Since
  energy and time can be explained only by science, there is a direct
  co-relation between physics and software projects like PostgreSQL,
  Linux.  Laws of science (Physics) applies everywhere and at all the
  times, to anything that you do, even while you are developing the
  software projects.

  Physics is in action even while you are talking (sound waves), walking
  (friction between ground and your feet), reading a book or writing
  software.  Every science in this world has a deep root in mathematics,
  including PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL uses 'Modern Algebra' which is a tiny
  branch of mathematics.  Modern algebra deals with 'Set Theory',
  'Relational Algebra', science of Groups, Rings, Collections, Sets,
  Unions, Intersections, Exclusions, Domains, Lists, etc...

  The software like PostgreSQL is existing today because of the energy
  and time.  And mass and energy are ONE and the SAME entity.  There are
  infinite number of methods to unlock mass and convert it into enery.
  Mass is a highly concentrated energy.  The fact that mass and energy
  are same was unknown to people 100 years ago!  And even today it is
  unknown to world population that internet is the largest software
  "power house" and the largest "software company" in the world!

  Cells in the human brains consume energy while processing (creating
  software), by converting the chemical energy from food into electrical
  and heat energy.  Even while you are reading this paragraph, the cells
  in your brain are burning out the fuel and are using tiny amounts of
  energy.  All of these implies that human brain is a thermodynamic heat
  engine.  Because human brain is a thermodynamic engine, the laws of
  thermodynamics applies to brain and hence thermodynamics has indirect
  effects on software like PostgreSQL.

  There can be infinite number of colors, computer langauages, computer
  chip designs and theories but there CANNOT be ONE SINGLE PERFECT
  color, computer language, design or system!  What you can have is only
  a  NEAR PERFECT color(wavelength), system, database, or theory!
  Nature is like a KALIEDOSCOPE - there are infinite number of
  dimensions, infinite variety particles of other dimensions but they
  all combine into very few primary dimensions and vice-versa.

  By combining the energies of millions of people around the world via
  internet it is possible to achieve a NEAR PERFECT system (including a
  database software system). Individually, the energy of each person
  will be minute, but by networking a large number of people, the total
  energy will be huge which can be focused on a project to generate a
  near perfect system.

  The energy is measured in Joules, kiloJoules or kilograms of mass, and
  time is measured in seconds or hours.  And power is energy divided by
  time and is measured in Watts or kiloWatts .

  ______________________________________________________________________
          Energy of each person = y Joules
  or in terms of mass
          Energy of each person = y grams
  The conversion factor between mass and energy is E = m * c * c
  where 'c' is the speed of light and 'm' is the mass.
          Time = 8 hours (This is constant since each person has only 8 hours a day)
          Power = Energy / Time
                    = (y / (8 * 60 * 60) ) Watts
          Total Power of the world = n * (y / (8 * 60 * 60) ) Watts
  where n = number of persons working on the project.
  ______________________________________________________________________


  From the above equation it is clear that increasing the 'n' will
  greatly improve the quality of product. Greater the 'n' then greater
  will be the power (in KiloWatts).  You can wonder how much total
  energy (in KiloJoules) and total power (in KiloWatts) the global
  internet can focus on a system like Linux and PostgreSQL!

  It is very clear that internet can network a vast number of people,
  which implies internet has a lot of energy and time which can produce
  much higher quality software products in much shorter time as compared
  to commercial companies. Even very big companies like Microsoft and
  IBM cannot overpower and overrule the laws of Physics but will
  eventually SURRENDER UNTO laws of science!

  Conclusion is - because of laws of science, 'open source code' system
  like PostgreSQL, Linux will prevail and will be always much better
  than 'closed source code' system and it is possible to prove this
  statement scientifically. Man should not waste time creating too many
  duplicate software products.

  3.  What is PostgreSQL ?

  PostgreSQL is a free database, complete source code is given to you
  and is an Object-Relational Database System targetting on ANSI ISO/SQL
  1998, 92 and runs on diverse hardware platforms and Operating systems.
  The ultimate objective and the final goal of PostgreSQL is to become
  100 % compliant to ANSI/ISO SQL and also to become the number ONE open
  generic Database in the world.

  PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and not
  Postgre-es-cue-el.

  Today, PostgreSQL is the most advanced system in the world and it is
  surprising that many commercial database systems could not match the
  quality, features and capabilities of PostgreSQL !! PostgreSQL is the
  joint effort of many nations around the globe and is a project similar
  to International Space Station. PostgreSQL will remain the number one
  database system for many decades into future since it is an open-
  source code system.

  The fundamental idea behind PostgreSQL is - once a module of code is
  written than you should not waste even a milli-second of your time
  trying to re-invent it!!

  Informix Universal server (released 1997) is based on earlier version
  of PostgreSQL because Informix bought Illustra Inc. and integrated
  with Informix. Illustra database was based on Postgres (earlier
  version of PostgreSQL).

  PostgreSQL is an enhancement of the POSTGRES database management
  system, a next-generation DBMS research prototype.  While PostgreSQL
  retains the powerful data model and rich data types of POSTGRES, it
  replaces the PostQuel query language with an extended subset of SQL.


  PostgreSQL development is being performed by a team of Internet
  developers who all subscribe to the PostgreSQL development mailing
  list. The current coordinator is Marc G. Fournier

  ·  scrappy@postgreSQL.org

     This team is now responsible for all current and future development
     of PostgreSQL.  Ofcourse, the database customer himself is the
     developer of PostgreSQL!  The development load is distributed among
     a very large number of database end-users on internet.

  The authors of PostgreSQL 1.01 were Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen.  The
  original Postgres code, from which PostgreSQL is derived, was the
  effort of many graduate students, undergraduate students, and staff
  programmers and working under the direction of Professor Michael
  Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley.

  Millions of PostgreSQL is installed as Database servers, Web database
  servers and Application data servers.  It is very sophisticated object
  relational database system (ORDBMS).

  PostgreSQL runs on Solaris, SunOS, HPUX, AIX, Linux, Irix, Digital
  Unix, BSDi,NetBSD, FreeBSD, SCO unix, NEXTSTEP, Unixware and all and
  every flavor of Unix. Port to Windows NT is done using Cygnus cygwin32
  package.

  3.1.  White Paper

  PostgreSQL details in nutshell:

  ·  Title:             PostgreSQL SQL RDBMS Database (Object Relational
     Database Management System)

  ·  Current Version:   7.0.1

  ·  Age:               PostgreSQL is 15 years old. Developed since 1985

  ·  Authors:           Developed by millions/universities/companies on
     internet for the past 15 YEARS

     The white paper on PostgreSQL is at <http://www.greatbridge.com>.

  PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and not
  Postgre-es-cue-el.

  4.  Which one? PostgreSQL or MySQL ?


  4.1.  PostgreSQL defeated Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL server and others!!

  PostgreSQL defeated Oracle 8 (and 8i), IBM DB2, MS SQL server, Sybase,
  Interbase and MySQL in standard benchmark tests in performance, speed,
  scalability and reliability!  Read the benchmarks at
  <http://www.aldev.8m.com> or at  <http://aldev.webjump.com>

  4.2.  MySQL and other duplicate RDBMSes

  MySQL is another open-source SQL server, but it does not support
  transactions. It is suitable for very small databases and does not
  support advanced SQL functionalities. Whereas PostgreSQL is an
  enterprise strength database supporting transactions and almost all
  SQL constructs.  PostgreSQL is much more advanced than commercial
  databases like Oracle, Sybase and Informix. PostgreSQL supports very
  advanced locking mechanisms and many more advanced features which are
  not available in commercial database systems!!

  In near future development of MySQL will be dropped, since MySQL is
  duplicate product working towards ANSI SQL.  We would take the most
  advanced and mature open-source SQL server and drop all others as we
  do not have lots of time (to deal with multiple RDBMSes)!! In fact,
  you do not have time to deal with just one powerful SQL server like
  PostgreSQL!  And all the MySQL users will be migrated to PostgreSQL.
  Also MySQL is a 'quasi-commercial' product unlike PostgreSQL which is
  open-source and there is no license fee.  There is no need for another
  SQL database system as PostgreSQL is already here in this world!!

  Duplicate products like MySQL confuse the user base and causes
  division of resources. For a "NEAR PERFECT" system there must be only
  one system and everybody in the world must work on it!!  Duplicate
  products cause more harm than good and hence division of resources
  must be strongly discouraged. This already happened in case of
  commercial database systems like Oracle, Sybase, Informix and MS SQL
  server which caused splintering of user base and often they are
  incompatible.  I want put the source code of SQL server under your
  control!!!

  You do not need hundreds of database systems, all you need is just one
  best database server which happens to be 'PostgreSQL'.

  WARNING:  It is possible to create infinite number of database systems
  for a given specification like ANSI SQL!!

  Features which are missing in MySQL and which PostgreSQL supports are
  -

  ·  Transactions

  ·  Stored Procedures

  ·  Triggers (update, insert and delete)

  ·  Object oriented databases

  ·  Advanced locking systems, concurrency management under multi-user,
     mutli-transactions environment

  ·  Sub-queries

  ·  Server-side cursors

  ·  Query caching

  ·  Locking of databases

  ·  Better table join supports (JOIN, UNION, MINUS, INTERSECT, outer
     join)

  ·  And many more advanced features - too numerous to list here.

  MySQL is at  <http://www.tcx.se>

  4.3.  Limitations of MySQL

  PostgreSQL should be compared with systems like Oracle, both are
  really true ACID compliant robust systems developed over a very long
  time.  It is very much wrong to compare MySQL with Oracle or MySQL
  with PostgreSQL. For more details read Why Not MySQL
  <http://openacs.org/philosophy/why-not-mysql.html>.  Hence, it will be
  a very serious mistake to replace Oracle with MySQL!!  If you want to
  replace Oracle then consider PostgreSQL.

  5.  Where to get it ?

  6.  PostgreSQL Quick-Installation Instructions

  PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and not
  Postgre-es-cue-el.

  This chapter will help you to install and run the database very
  quickly in less than 5 minutes.


  6.1.  Install and Test

  Quick Steps to Install, Test, Verify and run PostgreSQL Login as root.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # cd /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS
  # man rpm
  # ls postgre*.rpm
  # rpm -qpl postgre*.rpm | less (to see list of files)
  # rpm -qpi postgre*.rpm (to see info of package)
  # cat /etc/passwd | grep postgres
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Note: If you see a 'postgres' user, you may need to backup and clean
  up the postgres home directory  postgres and delete the unix user
  'postgres' or rename the unix user 'postgres' to something like 'post­
  gres2'.  Install must be "clean slate"

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # rpm -i postgre*.rpm (Must install all packages clients, devel, data
           and main for pgaccess to work )
  # man chkconfig
  # chkconfig --add postgresql  (to start pg during booting)
  # /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql start  (to start up postgres)
  # man xhost
  # xhost +  (To give display access for pgaccess)
  # su - postgres
  bash$ man createdb
  bash$ createdb mydatabase
  bash$ man psql
  bash$ psql mydatabase
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s

  bash$ export DISPLAY=<hostname>:0.0
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess mydatabase
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Now you can start rapidly BANGING away SQL commands at psql or pgac­
  cess.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ cd /usr/doc/postgresql*

  # gv maximum-rpm.ps.gz
  ______________________________________________________________________


  There is also rpm2deb which converts the RPM packages to Debian linux
  packages.

  6.4.  Examples RPM

  Examples are needed to do testing of various interfaces to PostgreSQL.
  Install the postgresql examples directory from  -

  ·  Linux cdrom - postgresql-*examples.rpm

  ·  postgresql-*examples.rpm from <http://www.aldev.8m.com> and mirrors
     at webjump <http://aldev.webjump.com>, angelfire
     <http://www.angelfire.com/nv/aldev>, geocities
     <http://www.geocities.com/alavoor/index.html>, virtualave
     <http://aldev.virtualave.net>, bizland <http://aldev.bizland.com>,

  Install examples package, see ``'' and then do -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  root# chown -R postgres.postgres /var/lib/pgsql/examples
  bash$ cd /var/lib/pgsql/examples/sql
  Under-development..
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6.11.  Testing Tcl/Tk interfaces

  Example of Tcl/Tk interfaces is pgaccess program.  Read the file
  /usr/bin/pgaccess using an editor -


  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ view /usr/bin/pgaccess
  bash$ export DISPLAY=<hostname of your machine>:0.0
  bash$ createdb mydb
  bash$ pgaccess mydb
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6.12.  Testing ODBC interfaces


  1. Get the win32 pgsql odbc driver from
     <http://www.insightdist.com/psqlodbc/>

  2. See also /usr/lib/libpsqlodbc.a

  6.13.  Testing MPSQL Motif-worksheet interfaces

  Get the RPMs from  <http://www.mutinybaysoftware.com>

  6.14.  Verification

  To verify the top quality of PostgreSQL, run the Regression test
  package :- Login as root -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # rpm -i postgresql*test.rpm
  And see README file or install the source code tree which has regress directory
  # rpm -i postgresql*.src.rpm
  # cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
  # more postgresql*.spec   (to see what system RPM packages you need to
  install)
  # rpm -bp postgresql*.spec  (.. this will prep the package)

  Regression test needs the Makefiles and some header files like *fmgr*.h
  which can be built by -
  # rpm --short-circuit -bc postgresql*.spec ( .. use short circuit to
  bypass!)
  Abort the build by CTRL+C, when you see 'make -C common  SUBSYS.o'
  By this time configure is successful and all makefiles and headers
  are created. You do not need to proceed any further
  # cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
  # chown -R postgres postgresql*
  # su - postgres
  bash$ cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/postgresql-6.5.3/src/test/regress
  bash$ more README
  bash$ make clean; make all runtest
  bash$ more regress.out
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6.15.  Emergency Bug fixes

  Sometimes emergency bug fix patches are released after the GA release
  of PostgreSQL. You can apply these optional patches depending upon the
  needs of your application. Follow these steps to apply the patches -
  Change directory to postgresql source directory



                  # rpm -i postgresql*.src.rpm
                  # cd /usr/src/postgresql6.5.3
                  # man patch
                  # patch -p0 < patchfile
                  # make clean
                  # make



  The patch files are located in

  ·  PostgreSQL patches :  <ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/patches>

  7.  Quick Start Guide

  Refer also to ``Quick Installation'' chapter.

  7.1.  Creating, Dropping, Renaming Database

  You can use the user friendly GUI called 'pgaccess' to create and drop
  databases, or you can use the command line 'psql' utility.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  If you are logged in as root, switch user to 'postgres' :
  # xhost +  (To give display access for pgaccess)
  # su - postgres
  bash$ man createdb
  bash$ createdb mydatabase
  bash$ man psql
  bash$ psql mydatabase
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s

  bash$ export DISPLAY=<hostname>:0.0
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess mydatabase
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Now you can start rapidly BANGING away SQL commands at psql or pgac­
  cess !!

  To drop the database do :

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man dropdb
  bash$ man destroydb   (for older versions of pgsql)
  bash$ dropdb <dbname>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  It is also possible to destroy a database from within an SQL session
  by using:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  > drop database <dbname>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  To rename a database see ``Backup and Restore''

  7.2.  Creating, Dropping users

  To create new users, login as unix user 'postgres'.  You can use user
  friendly GUI tool called 'pgacess' to create, drop users.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess <database_name>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  and click on "Users" tab and then click Object|New or Object|Delete

  You can also use command line scripts.  Use the shell script called
  'createuser' which invokes psql

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man createuser
  bash$ createuser <username>
  bash$ createuser -h host -p port -i userid <username>
  ______________________________________________________________________



  To drop a postgres user, use shell script 'destroyuser' -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man dropuser
  bash$ man destroyuser  (older versions of pgsql)
  bash$ destroyuser
  ______________________________________________________________________



  7.3.  Creating, Dropping Groups

  Currently, there is no easy interface to set up user groups. You have
  to explicitly insert/update the pg_group table. For example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - postgres
  bash$ psql <database_name>
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s

  psql=> insert into pg_group (groname, grosysid, grolist)
  psql=> values ('posthackers', '1234', '{5443, 8261}' );
  INSERT 58224
  psql=> grant insert on foo to group posthackers;
  CHANGE
  psql=>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  The fields in pg_group are: groname The group name. This name should
  be purely alphanumeric; do not include underscores or other punctua­
  tion.

  grosysid The group id. This is an int4, and should be unique for each
  group.

  grolist The list of pg_user IDs that belong in the group. This is an
  int4[].

  To drop the group:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - postgres
  bash$ psql <database_name>
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s

  psql=> delete from pg_group where groname = 'posthackers';
  ______________________________________________________________________



  7.4.  Create, Edit, Drop a table

  You can use user friendly GUI tool 'pgaccess' or command line tool
  'psql' to create, edit or drop a table in a database.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess <database_name>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Click on Table | New | Design buttons.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man psql
  bash$ psql <database_name>
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s
  ______________________________________________________________________


  At psql prompt, give standard SQL statements like 'create table',
  'alter table' or 'drop table' to manipulate the tables.

  7.5.  Create, Edit, Drop records in a table

  You can use user friendly GUI tool 'pgaccess' or command line tool
  'psql' to create, edit or drop records in a database table.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess <database_name>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Click on Table | < pick a table > | Open buttons.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man psql
  bash$ psql <database_name>
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s
  ______________________________________________________________________


  At psql prompt, give standard SQL statements like 'insert into
  table_name', 'update table_name' or 'delete from table_name' to manip­
  ulate the tables.

  7.6.  Switch active Database

  You can use user friendly GUI tool 'pgaccess' or command line tool
  'psql' to switch active database.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man pgaccess
  bash$ pgaccess <database_name>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Click on Database | Open buttons.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man psql
  bash$ psql <database_name>
  ..... in psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s

  psql=> connect <database_name> <user>
  ______________________________________________________________________



  7.7.  Backup and Restore database

  PostgreSQL provides two utilities to back up your system: pg_dump to
  backup individual databases, and pg_dumpall to back up all the
  databases in just one step.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - postgres
  bash$ man pd_dump
  bash$ pd_dump <database_name> > database_name.pgdump

  To dump all databases -
  bash$ man pg_dumpall
  bash$ pg_dumpall -o > db_all.out

  To reload (restore) a database dumped with pg_dump:
  bash$ cat database_name.pgdump | psql <database_name>

  To reload (restore) all databases dumped with pg_dumpall:
  bash$ psql -e template1 < db_all.out
  ______________________________________________________________________


  This technique can be used to move databases to new locations, and to
  rename existing databases.

  WARNING: Every database should be backed up on a regular basis. Since
  PostgreSQL manages its own files in the file sysetem, it is not
  advisable to rely on system backups of your file system for your
  database backups; there is no guarantee that the files will be in an
  usable, consistent state after restoration.

  BACKUP LARGE DATABASES: Since Postgres allows tables larger than the
  maximum file size on your system, it can be problematic to dump the
  table to a file, because the resulting file likely will be larger than
  the maximum size allowed by your system. As pg_dump writes to stdout,
  you can just use standard unix tools to work around this possible
  problem - use compressed dumps.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ pg_dump <database_name> | gzip > filename.dump.gz
  Reload with :
  bash$ createdb <database_name>
  bash$ gunzip -c filename.dump.gz | psql <database_name>
  Or
  bash$ cat filename.dump.gz | gunzip | psql <database_name>
  Use split:
  bash$ pg_dump <database_name> | split -b 1m - filename.dump.
  Note: There is a dot (.) after filename.dump in the above command!!
  You can reload with:
  bash$ man createdb
  bash$ createdb <database_name>
  bash$ cat filename.dump.* | pgsql <database_name>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Of course, the name of the file (filename) and the content of the
  pg_dump output need not match the name of the database. Also, the
  restored database can have an arbitrary new name, so this mechanism is
  also suitable for renaming databases.

  Backup LARGE Objects: Large objects are not handled by pg_dump. The
  directory contrib/pg_dumplo of the Postgres source tree contains a
  program that can do that.

  FILESYSTEM BACKUP : You can use the linux OS tools and commands to
  backup the entire database.  But you must completely shutdown the
  postgresql database server before doing backup or restore with this
  method.  The filesystem backup or restore may be 2 to 3 times faster
  than the pg_dump command, but only disadvantage is that you must
  completely shutdown the database server.  It is very highly
  recommended that you use backup and restore tools like Arkeia, Bru
  which are given in Mic-Lin analogy list sub-heading "Backup and
  Restore Utility" at <http://aldev.8m.com> and mirror sites are at
  webjump <http://aldev.webjump.com>, angelfire

  <http://homepages.infoseek.com/~aldev1/index.html>, bcity
  <http://www3.bcity.com/aldev>, 50megs <http://aldev.50megs.com> .The
  OS commands to use are -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man tar
  bash$ tar -cvf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data
  or using compression
  bash$ tar -zcvf backup.tgz /usr/local/pgsql/data
  ______________________________________________________________________



  INCREMENTAL BACKUP : This is in todo list and will appear in future
  release of PostgreSQL.

  7.8.  Security of database

  See the chapter on ``PostgreSQL Security''.

  7.9.  Online help

  It is very important that you should know how to use online help
  facilities of PostgreSQL, since it will save you lot of time and
  provides very quick access to information.
  See the online man pages on various commands like createdb,
  createuser, etc..

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man createdb
  ______________________________________________________________________



  See also online help of psql, by typing \h at psql prompt

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ psql mydatabase
  psql> \h

  Tip: In psql press up/down arrow keys for history line editing or \s
  ______________________________________________________________________



  7.10.  Creating Triggers and Stored Procedures

  To create triggers or stored procedures, First run 'createlang' script
  to install 'plpgsql' in the particular database you are using. If you
  want by default then install it in 'template1' and subsequent created
  databases will be clones of template1.  See 'createlang' web page in
  User guide at /usr/doc/postgresql-7.0.2/user/index.html.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man createlang
  bash$ createdb mydb
  bash$ export PGLIB=/usr/lib/pgsql
  bash$ createlang plpgsql mydb
  bash$ createlang plpgsql template1
  ______________________________________________________________________


  See also the trigger, stored procedures examples in ``''. One sample
  code from examples RPM:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  create function tg_pfield_au() returns opaque as '
  begin
      if new.name != old.name then
          update PSlot set pfname = new.name where pfname = old.name;
      end if;
      return new;
  end;

  create trigger tg_pfield_au after update
      on PField for each row execute procedure tg_pfield_au();
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Another trigger example sample code:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  create trigger check_fkeys_pkey_exist
          before insert or update on fkeys
          for each row
          execute procedure
          check_primary_key ('fkey1', 'fkey2', 'pkeys', 'pkey1', 'pkey2');
  ______________________________________________________________________


  You must also install the TEST package - postgresql-test-7.0.2-2.rpm
  and read the example sql scripts at - /usr/lib/pgsql/test/regress/sql

  To see the list of triggers in database do -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ psql mydb
  psql=> \?
  psql=> \dS
  psql=> \d pg_trigger
  psql=> select tgname from pg_trigger order by tgname;
  ______________________________________________________________________



  To see the list of functions and stored procedures in database do -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ psql mydb
  psql=> \?
  psql=> \dS
  psql=> \d pg_proc
  psql=> select proname, prosrc from pg_proc order by proname;
  psql=> \df
  ______________________________________________________________________



  7.11.  PostgreSQL Documentation

  More questions, read the fine manuals of PostgreSQL which are very
  extensive.  PostgreSQL documentation is distributed with package. See
  the other manuals. The release docs are at
  <http://www.postgresql.org/users-lounge/docs>.

  8.  Performance Tuning of PostgreSQL server

  Generally database server is standalone box connected to network.
  Since database server is the only unix process which runs on the CPU,
  you can do several optimizations to speed up the server.

  8.1.  OS Tuning for Database server

  To get more bang for a given CPU processing power, do the following:-

  ·  Recompile linux kernel to make it small and lean. Remove items
     which are not used. See kernel howto at
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html>


  ·  Turn off unneccessary unix processes - on linux/unix systems run
     chkconfig

     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# man chkconfig
     bash# chkconfig --help
     bash# chkconfig --list | grep on | less
     From the above list, turn off the processes you do not want to start automatically -
     bash# chkconfig --level 0123456 <service name> off
     Next time when the machine is booted these services will not be started.
     Now, shutdown the services manually which you just turning off.
     bash# cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
     bash# ./<service name> stop
     ___________________________________________________________________

  ·  Do not run any other application processes which are unnecessary.


  ·  Do not leave X-Window running unattended. Because X-window
     processes consume memory, CPU load and can be a serious security
     hole from outside attacks.  The X-window managers generally used
     are KDE, GNOME, CDE, XDM and others.  You must exit the X-window
     immediately after using and most of the time you should see command
     line console login prompt on the database server machine.

  8.2.  Tuning Database server process

  General tuning tips:

  ·  Indices can speed up queries. The explain command allows you to see
     how PostgreSQL is interpreting your query, and which indices are
     being used.

  ·  Use the cluster command to group data in base tables to match an
     index. See the man cluster(1) manual page for more details.

  ·  If you are doing a lot of inserts, consider doing them in a large
     batch using the copy command. This is much faster than individual
     inserts.

  ·  Statements not in a begin work/commit transaction block are
     considered to be in their own transaction. Consider performing
     several statements in a single transaction block. This reduces the
     transaction overhead. Also consider dropping and recreating indices
     when making large data changes.

  ·  It is suggested that you purchase the "Performance Tuning guide"
     and tuning support from PostgreSQL Corp.
     <http://www.postgresql.org>.

  Specialized tuning tips:


  ·  Internal tuning of PostgreSQL is a complex topic. You need a sound
     knowledge of source code and internals of postgresql. It is
     strongly recommended that only professionals attempt specialized
     tuning tips given below:

  ·  You can disable fsync() by starting the postmaster with a -o -F
     option. This will prevent fsync() from flushing to disk after
     every transaction. But there is risk of losing data due to
     power/media failure.  You can reduce the risk of losing data due to
     power failure by having the APC UPS
     <http://apc.com/products/ups.cfm> (Uninterrupted Power Supply) and
     media failures by disk RAID systems (Antares-Sparc-Raid
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Antares-RAID-sparcLinux-
     HOWTO/index.html> system, Software-Raid
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html> system,
     Old-Software-Raid <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Software-
     RAID-0.4x-HOWTO.html> system, Root-Raid
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Root-RAID-HOWTO.html> system, Boot-
     Root-Raid <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Boot+Root+Raid+LILO.html>
     system) to gaurd against media failures.

  ·  Use the postmaster -B option to increase the number of shared
     memory buffers used by the back-end processes. If you make this
     parameter too high, the postmaster may not start up because you've
     exceeded your kernel's limit on shared memory space. Each buffer is
     8K and the default is 64 buffers.


  ·  Use the back-end -S option to increase the maximum amount of memory
     used by each backend process for temporary sorts.  The -S value is
     measured in kilobytes, and the default is 512 (i.e., 512K).  It is
     unwise to make this value too large, or you may run out of memory
     when query invokes several concurrent sorts.

  9.  PostgreSQL Supports Extremely Large Databases greater than 200 Gig

  PostgreSQL is already used by many companies supporting large
  databases.  The following techniques are suggested :

  9.1.  CPU types - 32-bit or 64-bit

  Performance of 32-bit cpu machines will decline rapidly when the
  database size exceeds 5 GigaByte. You can run 30 gig database on
  32-bit cpu but the performance will be degraded.  Machines with 32-bit
  cpu imposes a limitation of 2 GB on RAM, 2 GB on file system sizes and
  other limitations on the operating system. Use the special filesystems
  for linux made by SGI, IBM or HP or ext3-fs to support file-sizes
  greater than 2 GB on 32-bit linux machines.

  For extremely large databases, it is strongly advised to use 64-bit
  machines like Digital Alpha cpu, Sun Ultra-sparc 64-bit cpu, Silicon
  graphics 64-bit cpu, Intel Merced IA-64 cpu, HPUX 64bit machines or
  IBM 64-bit machines. Compile PostgreSQL under 64-bit cpu and it can
  support huge databases and large queries. Performance of PostgreSQL
  for queries on large tables and databases will be several times faster
  than PostgreSQL on 32-bit cpu machines. Advantage of 64-bit machines
  are that you get very large memory addressing space and the operating
  system can support very large file-systems, provide better performance
  with large databases, support much larger memory (RAM), have more
  capabilities etc..

  9.2.  Multiple CPUs

  For large databases it is recommended that you use SMP boxes which
  have 4, 16 or 32 CPUs. Alternatively, you can use 4 or 5 single CPU
  boxes and you can partition the database into 4 or 5 seperate
  databases and each database running on a seperate box. Each CPU will
  be connected with fast NIC (100MBits) ethernet card.  For example - if
  you have 200 tables in a database, you can distribute 200 tables to 4
  database each having 50 tables.  In this way, you are distributing the
  load evenly among 4 seperate machines.  This is a cheaper alternative
  to 4-way CPU box. You would use NFS mounts in LAN, to accomplish this
  task. And each CPU "can see" all the databases i.e all the 200 tables.
  In future PostgreSQL may provide support for 'Queries across multiple
  databases' (already in the TODO list), which may appear in upcoming
  version 7.1.  For example, queries across multiple databases using
  aliases a, b for table names can be like -



  ______________________________________________________________________
  select a.col1, a.col2, b.col4, b.col7
  from
          database1.my_tablea a, database2.my_tableb b
  where
          a.col1 = b.col3 and
          a.col4 = b.col9;

  update my_tablea
  set
          col1 =  b.col2
  from
          database1.my_tablea a, database2.my_tableb b
  where
          a.col4 = b.col9;
  ______________________________________________________________________



  9.3.  Replication Server

  Replication server for large enterprises/businesses is available at
  <http://www.erserver.com> and from  <http://www.pgsql.com>.  The
  support is sold ($$$$s) commercially by PostgreSQL Inc. You use
  replication server to provide redundancy and high availability.
  Replication server is a complex, sophisticated product.

  10.  How can I trust PostgreSQL ? Regression Test Package builds cus­
  tomer confidence

  Thanks to "Laws of Physics", it is possible to SCIENTIFICALLY verify
  whether PostgreSQL is working as per ISO/ANSI SQL specifications.  To
  validate PostgreSQL, regression test package (src/test/regress) is
  included in the distribution.  Regression test package will verify the
  standard SQL operations as well as the extensibility capabilities of
  PostgreSQL.  The test package already contains hundreds of SQL test
  programs.

  You should use the computer's high-speed power to validate the
  PostgreSQL, instead of using human brain power.  Computers can carry
  out software regression tests millions or even billions of times
  faster than humans can.  Modern computers can run billions of SQL
  tests in a very short time.  In the near future the speed of computer
  will be several zillion times faster than human brain!  Hence, it
  makes sense to use the power of computer to validate the software.

  You can add more tests just in case you need to, and can upload to the
  primary PostgreSQL web site if you feel that it will be useful to
  others on internet.  Regression test package helps build customer
  confidence and trust in PostgreSQL and facilitates rapid deployment of
  PostgreSQL on production systems.

  Regression test package can be taken as a "VERY SOLID" technical
  document mutually agreed upon between the developers and end-users.
  PostgreSQL developers extensively use the regression test package
  during development period and also before releasing the software to
  public to ensure good quality.

  Capablilities of PostgreSQL are directly reflected by the regression
  test package.  If a functionality, syntax or feature exists in the
  regression test package then it is supported, and all others which are
  NOT listed in the package MAY not be supported by PostgreSQL!! You may
  need to verify those and add it to regression test package.



  11.  Security of Database

  Database security is addressed at several levels:

  ·  Database file protection. All files stored within the database are
     protected from reading by any account other than the postgres
     superuser account

  ·  Connections from a client to the database server are, by default,
     allowed only via an local UNIX socket, not via TCP/IP sockets. The
     back-end must be started with the -i option to allow nonlocal
     clients to connect.

  ·  Client connections can be restricted by IP address and/or username
     via the pg_hba.conf file in $PG_DATA.

  ·  Client connections may be authenticated via other external
     packages.

  ·  Each user in Postgres is assigned an username and (optionally) a
     password.  By default, users do not have write access to databases
     they did not create.

  ·  Users may be assigned to groups, and table access may be restricted
     based on group priveleges.

  11.1.  User Authentication

  Authentication is the process by which the backend server and
  postmaster ensure that the user requesting access to data is in fact
  who he/she claims to be. All users who invoke Postgres are checked
  against the contents of the pg_user class to ensure that they are
  authorized to do so. However, verification of the user's actual
  identity is performed in a variety of ways:

  ·  From the user shell: A backend server started from an user shell
     notes the user's (effective) user-id before performing a setuid to
     the user-id of user postgres. The effective user-id is used as the
     basis for access control checks. No other authentication is
     conducted.

  ·  From the network: If the Postgres system is built as distributed,
     access to the Internet TCP port of the postmaster process is
     available to anyone. The DBA configures the pg_hba.conf file in the
     $PGDATA directory to specify what authentication system is to be
     used according to the host making the connection and which database
     it is connecting to.  See pg_hba.conf(5) (man 5 pg_hba.conf) for a
     description of the authentication systems available. Of course,
     host-based authentication is not fool-proof in Unix, either. It is
     possible for determined intruders to also masquerade the
     origination host. Those security issues are beyond the scope of
     Postgres.

  11.2.  Host-Based Access Control

  Host-based access control is the name for the basic controls
  PostgreSQL exercises on what clients are allowed to access a database
  and how the users on those clients must authenticate themselves.  Each
  database system contains a file named pg_hba.conf, in its $PGDATA
  directory, which controls who can connect to each database.  Every
  client accessing a database must be covered by one of the entries in
  pg_hba.conf. Otherwise all attempted connections from that client will
  be rejected with a "User authentication failed" error message.

  See online man page of pg_hba.conf(5) (man 5 pg_hba.conf).

  The general format of the pg_hba.conf file is of a set of records, one
  per line. Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash character ("#")
  are ignored. A record is made up of a number of fields which are
  separated by spaces and/or tabs.

  Connections from clients can be made using Unix domain sockets or
  Internet domain sockets (ie.  TCP/IP). Connections made using Unix
  domain sockets are controlled using records of the following format:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  local database authentication method
  ______________________________________________________________________


  where

  database specifies the database that this record applies to. The value
  all specifies that it applies to all databases.

  authentication method specifies the method an user must use to
  authenticate themselves when connecting to that database using Unix
  domain sockets. The different methods are described below.

  Connections made using Internet domain sockets are controlled using
  records of the following format.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  host database TCP/IP-address TCP/IP-mask authentication method
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The TCP/IP address is logically and'ed to both the specified TCP/IP
  mask and the TCP/IP address of the connecting client. If the two
  resulting values are equal then the record is used for this
  connection. If a connection matches more than one record then the
  earliest one in the file is used. Both the TCP/IP address and the
  TCP/IP mask are specified in dotted decimal notation.  If a connection
  fails to match any record then the reject authentication method is
  applied (see ``Authentication Methods'').

  11.3.  Authentication Methods

  The following authentication methods are supported for both Unix and
  TCP/IP domain sockets:

  ·  trust The connection is allowed unconditionally.

  ·  reject The connection is rejected unconditionally.

  ·  crypt The client is asked for a password for the user. This is sent
     encrypted (using crypt(3)) and compared against the password held
     in the pg_shadow table. If the passwords match, the connection is
     allowed.

  ·  password The client is asked for a password for the user. This is
     sent in clear and compared against the password held in the
     pg_shadow table. If the passwords match, the connection is allowed.
     An optional password file may be specified after the password
     keyword which is used to match the supplied password rather than
     the pg_shadow table. See pg_passwd.

  The following authentication methods are supported for TCP/IP domain
  sockets only:

  ·  krb4 Kerberos V4 is used to authenticate the user.

  ·  krb5 Kerberos V5 is used to authenticate the user.

  ·  ident The ident server on the client is used to authenticate the
     user (RFC 1413). An optional map name may be specified after the
     ident keyword which allows ident user names to be mapped onto
     Postgres user names. Maps are held in the file
     $PGDATA/pg_ident.conf.

  Here are some examples:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  # Trust any connection via Unix domain sockets.
  local   trust
  # Trust any connection via TCP/IP from this machine.
  host    all 127.0.0.1   255.255.255.255     trust
  # We don't like this machine.
  host    all 192.168.0.10    255.255.255.0       reject
  # This machine can't encrypt so we ask for passwords in clear.
  host    all 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.0       password
  # The rest of this group of machines should provide encrypted passwords.
  host    all 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0       crypt
  ______________________________________________________________________



  11.4.  Access Control

  Postgres provides mechanisms to allow users to limit the access to
  their data that is provided to other users.

  ·  Database superusers Database super-users (i.e., users who have
     pg_user.usesuper set) silently bypass all of the access controls
     described below with two exceptions: manual system catalog updates
     are not permitted if the user does not have pg_user.usecatupd set,
     and destruction of system catalogs (or modification of their
     schemas) is never allowed.

  ·  Access Privilege The use of access privilege to limit reading,
     writing and setting of rules on classes is covered in SQL
     grant/revoke(l).

  ·  Class removal and schema modification Commands that destroy or
     modify the structure of an existing class, such as alter, drop
     table, and drop index, only operate for the owner of the class. As
     mentioned above, these operations are never permitted on system
     catalogs.

  11.5.  Secure TCP/IP Connection via SSH

  You can use ssh to encrypt the network connection between clients and
  a Postgres server. Done properly, this should lead to an adequately
  secure network connection.

  The documentation for ssh provides most of the information to get
  started. Please refer to <http://www.heimhardt.de/htdocs/ssh.html> for
  better insight.  A step-by-step explanation can be done in just two
  steps.

  Running a secure tunnel via ssh: A step-by-step explanation can be
  done in just two steps.

  ·  Establish a tunnel to the back-end machine, like this:


     ___________________________________________________________________
     ssh -L 3333:wit.mcs.anl.gov:5432 postgres@wit.mcs.anl.gov
     ___________________________________________________________________



  ·  The first number in the -L argument, 3333, is the port number of
     your end of the tunnel. The second number, 5432, is the remote end
     of the tunnel -- the port number your backend is using.  The name
     or the address in between the port numbers belongs to the server
     machine, as does the last argument to ssh that also includes the
     optional user name. Without the user name, ssh will try the name
     you are currently logged on as on the client machine. You can use
     any user name the server machine will accept, not necessarily those
     related to postgres.

  ·  Now that you have a running ssh session, you can connect a postgres
     client to your local host at the port number you specified in the
     previous step. If it's psql, you will need another shell because
     the shell session you used in step 1 is now occupied with ssh.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     psql -h localhost -p 3333 -d mpw
     ___________________________________________________________________



  ·  Note that you have to specify the -h argument to cause your client
     to use the TCP socket instead of the Unix socket. You can omit the
     port argument if you chose 5432 as your end of the tunnel.

  11.6.  Kerberos Authentication

  Kerberos is an industry-standard secure authentication system suitable
  for distributed computing over a public network.

  Availability: The Kerberos authentication system is not distributed
  with Postgres. Versions of Kerberos are typically available as
  optional software from operating system vendors. In addition, a source
  code distribution may be obtained through MIT Project Athena.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  Note: You may wish to obtain the MIT version even if your vendor provides a version, since
  some vendor ports have been deliberately crippled or rendered non-interoperable with the MIT
  version.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Inquiries regarding your Kerberos should be directed to your vendor or
  MIT Project Athena. Note that FAQLs (Frequently-Asked Questions Lists)
  are periodically posted to the Kerberos mailing list (send mail to
  subscribe), and USENET news group.

  Installation: Installation of Kerberos itself is covered in detail in
  the Kerberos Installation Notes . Make sure that the server key file
  (the srvtab or keytab) is somehow readable by the Postgres account.
  Postgres and its clients can be compiled to use either Version 4 or
  Version 5 of the MIT Kerberos protocols by setting the KRBVERS
  variable in the file src/Makefile.global to the appropriate value. You
  can also change the location where Postgres expects to find the
  associated libraries, header files and its own server key file.  After
  compilation is complete, Postgres must be registered as a Kerberos
  service. See the Kerberos Operations Notes and related manual pages
  for more details on registering services.
  Operation: After initial installation, Postgres should operate in all
  ways as a normal Kerberos service. For details on the use of
  authentication, see the PostgreSQL User's Guide reference sections for
  postmaster and psql.

  In the Kerberos Version 5 hooks, the following assumptions are made
  about user and service naming(also, see Table below):

  ·  User principal names (anames) are assumed to contain the actual
     Unix/Postgres user name in the first component.

  ·  The Postgres service is assumed to be have two components, the
     service name and a hostname, canonicalized as in Version 4 (i.e.,
     with all domain suffixes removed).

  12.  GUI FrontEnd Tool for PostgreSQL (Graphical User Interface)

  Web browser will be the most popular GUI front-end in the future.  It
  is recommended that you migrate all of your "legacy" Windows 95/NT
  applications to  Web-based application.

  You should use Web-Application Servers like ``'' (Java based) or ``''
  (Python based) or ``''.

  Best web-scripting (and compiling) language is ``PHP+Zend compiler''
  PHP is extremely powerful as it combines the power of Perl, Java, C++,
  Javascript into one single language and it runs on all OSes - unixes
  and Windows NT/95.

  The best tools in the order of preference are -

  ·  Enhydra at ``'' plus Borland Java JBuilder for Linux
     <http://www.inprise.com>

  ·  Zope at ``''

  ·  OpenACS at ``''

  ·  PHP script and Zend compiler at ``PHP+Zend compiler''

  ·  X-Designer supports C++, Java and MFC  <http://www.ist.co.uk/xd>

  ·  Qt for Windows95 and Unix at  <http://www.troll.no> and
     <ftp://ftp.troll.no>

  ·  Code Crusader is on linux cdrom, freeware based on MetroWorks Code
     Warrior
     <http://www.kaze.stetson.edu/cdevel/code_crusader/about.html>

     <http://www.cygnus.com>

  ·  Borland C++ Builder for Linux  <http://www.inprise.com>

  ·  Borland Java JBuilder for Linux  <http://www.inprise.com>

  Language choices in the order of preference are -

  1. Java but its programs run very slow and has license fees. C++ is 5
     times faster than Java!!

  2. Python (Powerful object oriented scripting language).

  3. PHP Web server scripting, HTML, DHTML with Javascrpt client
     scripting and Java-Applets.

  4. Perl scripting language using Perl-Qt or Perl-Tk ``''

  5. Omnipresent and Omnipotent language C++ (GNU g++):

  ·  Fast CGI(written in GNU C++) with Javascript/Java-Applets as Web-
     GUI-frontend.

  ·  GNU C++ and QtEZ or QT

  ·  GNU C++ with Lesstiff or Motif.

  There are other tools available - PostgreSQL has Tcl/Tk interface
  library in the distribution called 'pgTcl'.  There is an IDE
  (integrated development environment) for Tcl/Tk called SpecTcl.

  13.  Interface Drivers for PostgreSQL


  13.1.  ODBC Drivers for PostgreSQL

  ODBC stands for 'Open DataBase Connectivity' established by Microsoft,
  is a popular standard for accessing information from various databases
  from different vendors. Applications written using the ODBC drivers
  are guaranteed to work with various databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle,
  Sybase, Informix etc..


  ·  PostODBC <http://www.insightdist.com/psqlodbc> is already included
     in the distribution. See main web site
     <http://www.postgresql.org>. It is included on the PostgreSQL
     CDROM.

  14.  Perl Database Interface (DBI) Driver for PostgreSQL


  14.1.  Perl interface for PostgreSQL

  PERL is an acronym for 'Practical Extraction and Report Language'.
  Perl is available on each and every operating system and hardware
  platform in the world.  You can use Perl on Windows95/NT, Apple
  Macintosh iMac, all flavors of Unix (Solaris, HPUX, AIX, Linux, Irix,
  SCO etc..), mainframe MVS, desktop OS/2, OS/400, Amdahl UTS and many
  others.  Perl runs EVEN on many unpopular or generally-unknown
  operating systems and hardware!!  So do not be surprised if you see
  perl running on a very rarely used operating system.  You can imagine
  the vast extent of the user base and developer base of Perl.  Perl
  language has a very long life just like "C" language, and Perl will be
  in use for thousands of years in the future! Perl runs 10 times faster
  than Java and sometimes faster than even "C".  Java is a very complex
  system with virtual machine and interpreter which makes it extremely
  slow, unstable and unreliable. Perl is very simple, fast and object
  oriented.

  Perl interface for PostgreSQL is included in the distribution of
  PostgreSQL. Check in src/pgsql_perl5 directory.

  14.2.  Perl Database Interface DBI

  14.2.1.  WHAT IS DBI ?

  The Perl Database Interface (DBI) is a database access Application
  Programming Interface (API) for the Perl Language. The Perl DBI API
  specification defines a set of functions, variables and conventions
  that provide a consistent database interface independent of the actual
  database being used.  The Database Drivers (Perl DBI) initiative has
  standardized the interface to a number of commercial database engines,
  so that you can move from, say, Oracle to PostgreSQL with a minimum of
  effort.

  14.2.2.  DBD driver for PostgreSQL

  Before you install DBD PostgreSQL (Driver) you must install DBI.  Get
  DBI driver from

     and perl -V, the version of PostgreSQL, the version of DBD-Pg, and
     the version of DBI in your bug-report.  E.Mergl@bawue.de

  14.2.4.  DBI Documents

  There are a few information sources on DBI.

  POD documentation:  PODs are chunks of documentation usually embedded
  within perl programs that document the code ``in place'', providing an
  useful resource for programmers and users of modules. POD for DBI and
  drivers is beginning to become more commonplace, and documentation for
  these modules can be read with the following commands.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  The POD for the DBI Specification can be read with the command
          $ perldoc DBI

  Users of the Oraperl emulation layer bundled with DBD::Oracle, may
  read up on how to program with the Oraperl interface by typing:
          $ perldoc Oraperl

  Users of the DBD::mSQL module may read about some of the private
  functions and quirks of that driver by typing:
          $ perldoc DBD::mSQL

  The Frequently Asked Questions is also available as
  POD documentation. Read this by typing:
          $ perldoc DBI::FAQ

  POD in general - Information on writing POD, and on the philosophy of POD in
  general, can be read by typing:
          $ perldoc perlpod
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Users with the Tk module installed may be interested to learn there is
  a Tk-based POD reader available called tkpod, which formats POD in a
  convenient and readable way.

  INFORMATION ABOUT LIBGTCL

  You will need the PostgreSQL to Tcl interface library libgtcl, lined
  as a Tcl/Tk 'load'-able module. The libpgtcl and the source is located
  in the PostgreSQL directory /src/interfaces/libpgtcl. Specifically,
  you will need a libpgtcl library that is 'load'-able from Tcl/Tk. This
  is technically different from an ordinary PostgreSQL loadable object
  file, because libpgtcl is a collection of object files. Under Linux,
  this is called libpgtcl.so.  You can download from the above site a
  version already compiled for Linux i386 systems. Just copy libpgtcl.so
  into your system library director (/usr/lib).  One of the solutions is
  to remove from the source the line containing load libpgtcl.so and to
  load pgaccess.tcl not with wish, but with pgwish (or wishpg) that wish
  that was linked with libpgtcl library.

  If you get crypt not found during compilation pgaccess source tree
  then use -lcrypt.

  15.2.  GtkSQL Graphical Query Tool for PostgreSQL

  GtkSQL is a graphical query tool (like PostgreSQL's psql). It is
  released under the GNU GPL license, and was developped using Gtk+
  1.2.3 and PostgreSQL 6.3.  The main site of GtkSQL is at
  <http://gtksql.sourceforge.net>

  Its main features are :

  1. multiple SQL buffers

  2. SQL keywords, table names and fields autocompletion

  3. easy displaying of table definition

  4. PostgreSQL and MySQL support (and easy addition of other databases)

     The current version is GtkSQL v. 0.3. You can get the source from
     <https://sourceforge.net/project/?form_grp=533>

  15.3.  Windows Interactive Query Tool for PostgreSQL (WISQL or MPSQL)

  MPSQL provides users with a graphical SQL interface to PostgresSQL.
  MPSQL is similar to Oracle's SQL Worksheet and Microsoft SQL Server's
  query tool WISQL.  It has nice GUI and has history of commands. Also
  you can cut and paste and it has other nice features to improve your
  productivity.

  15.7.  PgBash - SQL shell tool

  PgBash has functionality which is similar to psql.  And, PgBash
  provides the useful functionality in making flexible interactive
  operational environment using bash alias, function, the history
  editing, etc.

  The main  site of PgBash is at
  <http://www.psn.co.jp/PostgreSQL/pgbash/index-e.html>

  PgBash is a shell which included the "direct SQL" or the "embedded
  SQL" interface for PostgreSQL by the improvement on the bash(current
  version 2.03) shell.  PgBash can be used as a log-in shell, a sub-
  shell(the shell started from a shell) and a shell program use.

  Here, "Direct SQL" shows functionality which immediately outputs the
  result to the "standard output". And "Embedding SQL" shows
  functionality which sets the retrieval result into the shell variable
  and which deals with in shell script language.

  SQL statement(terminal character is a semicolon) is handled as one
  shell command, it is possible to execute the SQL statement with
  pipeline, redirection and background_job options. In addition, by
  using the exec_sql command, it is possible to execute SQL statement
  with the various options. The executive example of SQL is shown next.

  17.  Setting up multi-boxes PostgreSQL with just one monitor

  If you do want to spend money on hardware switches than you can use
  VNC (Virtual Network Computing) Technology from the telecom giant AT &
  T. VNC is GPLed and is a free software. Using VNC you can run
  PostgreSQL programs on computers without monitors and display on
  remote boxes with monitors!! But the boxes must be connected via
  ethernet Network Interface Cards.  VNC is at
  <http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc>

  You can stack up multiple CPU-boxes and connect to just one monitor
  and use the KVM (Keyboard, Video, Monitor) switch box to select the
  host.  This saves space and avoids a lot of clutter and also
  eliminates monitor, keyboard and the mouse (saving anywhere from 100
  to 500 US dollars per set).

  Using this switch box, you can stack up many PostgreSQL servers
  (development, test, production), Web servers, ftp servers, Intranet
  servers, Mail servers, News servers in a tower shelf. The switch box
  can be used for controlling Windows 95/NT or OS/2 boxes as well.

  Please check out these sites:

  ·  DataComm Warehouse Inc at 1-800-328-2261. They supply all varieties
     of computer hardware  <http://www.warehouse.com> 4-port Manual KVM
     switch (PS/2) is about $89.99 Part No. DDS1354

  ·  Network Technologies Inc
     <http://www.networktechinc.com/servswt.html> (120 dollars/PC 8
     ports) which lists

  ·  Scene Double Inc, England
     <http://www.scene.demon.co.uk/qswitch.htm>

  ·  Cybex corporation  <http://www.cybex.com>

  ·  Raritan Inc  <http://www.raritan.com>

  ·  RealStar Solutions Inc  <http://www.real-star.com/kvm.htm>

  ·  Belkin Inc  <http://www.belkin.com>


  ·  Better Box Communications Ltd.
     <http://www.betterbox.com/info.html>

  ·  Go to nearest hardware store and ask for "Server Switch" also known
     as "KVM Auto Switches".

  Search engine yahoo to find more companies with "Server Switches" or
  "KVM Switches".

  It is strongly recommended to have a dedicated unix box for each
  PostgreSQL data-server for better performance. No other application
  program/processes should run on this box. See the Business section of
  your local newspapers for local vendors selling only intel box, 13"
  monochrome monitor (very low cost monitor). Local vendors sell just
  the hardware without any Microsoft Windows/DOS.  You do not need a
  color monitor for the database server, as you can do remote
  administration from color PC workstation.

  You can buy bare-bone computer hardware from online stores. You can
  get good rates in "Online Auctions"

  ·  Online store and auction hall  <http://www.egghead.com>

  ·  Online store  <http://www.buy.com>

  ·  Bidding store  <http://www.ubid.com>

  Get RedHat (or some other distribution of) Linux cdrom from below -

  ·  Linux System Labs Web site:   <http://www.lsl.com/>  7 (U.S.
     dollars)

  ·  Cheap Bytes Inc Web site:   <http://www.cheapbytes.com/> 7 (U.S.
     dollars)

     Make sure that the hardware you purchase is supported by Redhat
     Linux. Check the ftp site of Redhat for recommended hardware like
     SCSI adapters, video cards before buying.  For just $ 600 you will
     get a powerful intel box with Redhat Linux running PostgreSQL.  Use
     odbc/jdbc/perl/tcl to connect to PostgreSQL from Windows95, OS/2,
     Unix Motif or web browser (e.g. Redbaron, Opera, Netscape, 20
     others).  (Web browsers are very fast becoming the standard GUI
     client).

  Using KVM switch you can control many cpu boxes by just one monitor
  and one keyboard!

  18.  Web-Application-Servers for PostgreSQL

  Several Web-Application-Servers work with PostgreSQL both open-source
  and commercial versions. The popular open-source Web-Application-
  Servers are Perl based Application Servers like Mason, WIRM,
  Velocigen, Enhydra(Java) and Zope(Python) and commercial Web-
  Application-Servers are IBM Websphere, BEA Weblogic.

  It is recommeded that you use secure web server like Apache + mod_ssl
  + OpenSSL.  See Redhat StrongHold secure server at
  <http://www.c2.net/products/sh3>.

  Web Application Servers can be classified according to the programming
  language which they support.  You must choose a Web Application server
  based on the programming language which you like the most.

  Classifications of Web Application servers are:


  ·  Based on PERL language

  ·  Based on PHP language (which is similar to PERL, little Java-like)

  ·  Based on Python language (Object oriented scripting language)

  ·  Based on Java language (Sun Microsystems Java)

  ·  Based on Tcl language (Tcl/Tk - called "Tickle" scripting language)

  ·  Based on C++ language (C++ and CORBA)

  ·  Based on Pike (C++ like scripting language)

  18.1.  PERL Web Application Servers

  Perl language has a very long life just like "C" language, and Perl
  will be in use for a long time  in the future! Perl runs 3 times
  faster than Java for some operations (but Java runs faster than perl
  for some operations).  Java is a very complex system with virtual
  machine and interpreter which makes it extremely slow, unstable and
  unreliable. Perl is very simple, fast and object oriented.

  Also Perl programs can be easily compiled for even better performance.
  Use Perl2Exe which is a command line utility for converting perl
  scripts to executable files   <http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm>

  The following Web Applicaiton servers are available for PERL

  ·  Mason  <http://www.masonhq.com> is a powerful Perl-based web site
     development and delivery engine. With Mason you can embed Perl code
     in your HTML and construct pages from shared, reusable components.


  ·  BingoX  <http://opensource.cnation.com/projects/BingoX> is an open
     source, object oriented Web Application Framework written in
     mod_perl meant to dramatically reduce the time required to build
     large dynamic, database driven web sites and applications.


  ·  SmartWorker is a collection of Perl classes that allow you to build
     web applications like they were true applications and not just HTML
     templates with random embedded code.  SmartWorker
     <http://www.smartworker.org>


  ·  Apache-Perl integration project With mod_perl it is possible to
     write Apache modules entirely in Perl. In addition, the persistent
     interpreter embedded in the server avoids the overhead of starting
     an external interpreter and the penalty of Perl start-up time.
     Visit  <http://perl.apache.org> and also see mod_perl_garden
     project at  <http://modperl.sourcegarden.org>


  ·  Apache::ASP  <http://www.apache-asp.org> provides an Active Server
     Pages port to the Apache Web Server with Perl as the host scripting
     language.  Apache::ASP allows a developer to create dynamic web
     applications with session management and embedded perl code. There
     are also many powerful extensions, including XML taglibs, XSLT
     rendering, and new events not originally part of the ASP API.


  ·  WIRM (Web Interface Repository Manager) is a Perl-based application
     server that provides a high-level programming environment for
     developing web information systems. The WIRM consists of an object-
     relational database and a suite of Perl interfaces for visualizing,
     integrating and analyzing heterogeneous multimedia data. WIRM
     provides facilities for creating context-sensitive views over a
     multimedia database, allowing developers to rapidly build dynamic
     web sites that adapt their content and presentation to multiple
     classes of end-users.  Visit  <http://www.wirm.org>


  ·  EmbPerl  <http://perl.apache.org/embperl> Embperl gives you the
     power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents. Using Perl means
     being able to use a very elaborate programming language, which is
     widely used for WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl
     modules which have already been written - including DBI - for
     database access to a growing number of database systems.


  ·  ePerl  <http://www.engelschall.com/sw/eperl> interprets an ASCII
     file bristled with Perl 5 program statements by evaluating the Perl
     5 code while passing through the plain ASCII data. It can operate
     in various ways: As a stand-alone Unix filter or integrated Perl 5
     module for general file generation tasks and as a powerful
     Webserver scripting language for dynamic HTML page programming.


  ·  XPP  <http://opensource.cnation.com/projects/XPP> XPP stands for
     'XPP Parses Perl' or 'XPML Page Parser', and is a fast/efficient
     HTML parser that parses embedded perl, as well as HTML like tags,
     from dynamic html pages called XPML pages.


  ·  Gamla - a perl-based RAD and application server The gamla project
     aims to create a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool and a web
     application server based on Perl.  All the source code produced by
     the Gamla project will be under the public domain.

     Gamla at  <http://gamla.iglu.org.il>


  ·  AxKit  <http://www.axkit.org> is an XML Application Server for
     Apache (and mod_perl). It provides on-the-fly conversion from XML
     to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using either W3C standard
     techniques, or flexible custom code. AxKit also uses a built-in
     Perl interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful techniques for
     XML transformation.

     The emphasis with AxKit is on separation of content from
     presentation. The pipelining technique that AxKit uses allows
     content to be converted to a presentable format in stages, allowing
     certain platforms to see data differently to others. AxKit allows
     web designers to focus on web site design, content developers to
     work on a purely content basis, and webmasters to focus on their
     core competencies.

  Commercial Web Application Servers for Perl:

  ·  Zelerate AllCommerce
     <http://www.zelerate.org/html/eng/home.shtml> is a commerce,
     content, customer and relationship management system. This high-
     performance, scalable Internet application is written in Perl and
     uses a backend database.


  ·  VelociGen serves dynamic content stored in XML, the database or
     live data feeds as fast as static HTML - up to 60x faster than CGI
     without the need to modify your exiting application.  VelociGen
     also makes new development easier with server-side XML tags, crash
     protection and load balancing across multiple machines.
     VelociGen plugs seamlessly into any Web server on any platform,
     increasing server performance and speeding the response times of
     dynamic content driven web sites. VelociGen can process large
     volumes of simultaneous requests as much as 10x faster than Java
     Servlets and 4x faster than Cold Fusion.

     Velocigen  <http://www.binevolve.com/velocigen>

  18.2.  PHP Web Application Servers

  The following Web Applicaiton servers are available for PHP

  ·  Midgard PHP Web Application server is based on the PHP scripting
     language and PHP runs extremely fast - faster than Java.  The main

  19.  Applications and Tools for PostgreSQL


  19.1.  PostgreSQL 4GL for web database applications - AppGEN Develop­
  ment System

  AppGEN can be downloaded from

  ·  <http://www.man.ac.uk/~whaley/ag/appgen.html>

  ·  <ftp://ftp.mcc.ac.uk/pub/linux/ALPHA/AppGEN>.

     AppGEN is a high level fourth generation language and application
     generator for producing World Wide Web (WWW) based applications.
     These applications are typically used over the internet or within a
     corporate intranet. AppGEN applications are implemented as C
     scripts conforming to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard
     supported by most Web Servers.

  To use AppGEN you will need the following :-

  PostgresSQL, relational database management system

  A CGI compatible web server such as NCSA's HTTPD

  An ansi C compiler such as GCC

  AppGEN consists of the following Unix (Linux) executables :-


  ·  defgen, which produces a basic template application from a logical
     data structure. The applications are capable of adding, updating,
     deleting and searching for records within the database whilst
     automatically maintaining referential integrity.


  ·  appgen, the AppGEN compiler which compiles the appgen source code
     into CGI executable C source and HTML formatted documents ready for
     deployment on a web server.


  ·  dbf2sql, an utility for converting dBase III compatible .dbf files
     into executable SQL scripts. This enables data stored in most
     DOS/Windows based database packages to be migrated to a SQL server
     such as PostgresSQL.

  ·  In addition, AppGEN comprises of a collection of HTML documents,
     GIF files and Java applets which are used at runtime by the system.
     And of course, like all good software, the full source code is
     included.

     About DBENGINE : dbengine is an interface between the WWW and
     Postgres95 which provides simple access to any existing database
     within just a few minutes.

  PHP gives you a Perl like language in your documents, but no real Perl
  while AppGen and wdb-p95 require that you create some configuration
  file for each of your databases -- sound's like you'll first of all
  have to learn some sort of new meta language before you can get
  started.

  Unlike other tools you don't have to learn any special programming or
  scripting language to get started with dbengine. Also there's no
  configuration file for each database, so you don't have to get
  familiar with such a new structure.  However - in case you want to
  gain access to the full features of dbengine it'd be a good idea to
  know the Perl language.

  The whole system can be configured by simple manipulations of an
  additional database that contains closer information about how to
  visualize your database access.  You can even specify virtual Fields
  which are calculated on the fly right before they're displayed on the
  screen.

  19.3.  Apache Webserver Module for PostgreSQL - NeoSoft NeoWebScript

  Apache is a well-known Web Server. And a module to interface
  PostgreSQL to Apache Webserver is at -

  ·  <http://www.neosoft.com/neowebscript/>

     NeoWebScript is a programming language that allows both simple and
     complex programs to be embedded into HTML files.

  When an HTML page containing embedded NeoWebScript is requested, the
  NeoWebScript-enabled webserver executes the embedded script(s),
  producing a webpage containing customized content created by the
  program.

  NeoWebScript is a fast, secure, easy to learn way to do powerful,
  server-based interactive programming directly in the HTML code in web
  pages. With NeoWebScript, counters, email forms, graffiti walls, guest
  books and visitor tracking are all easy, even for a beginning
  programmer. See how well NeoWebScript holds its' own vs. PERL and
  JavaScript.

  If you'd like to install NeoWebScript on your webserver, your
  Webmaster needs to read our Sysop FAQ to get started. Theory of
  Operations will explain how NeoWebScript works, while installation
  will take them through the steps. Management deals with configuration
  issues and running the server, tests let you verify correct
  NeoWebScript operation, and troubleshooting deals with server
  problems.

  There is no cost to you to use NeoWebScript-2.2 for your ISP, your
  intranet, or your extranet.  You'll see a full license when you
  register to download, but it costs $ 99 if you want to embed it in
  your own product or use it in a commerce (eg. SSL) server.


  NeoWebScript is a module for the Apache webserver that allows you to
  embed the Tcl/Tk programming language in your webpages as a scripting
  tool. It was invented by Karl Lehenbauer, NeoSoft's Chief Technical
  Officer, and documented, enhanced and extended by NeoSoft's
  programmers and technical writers.

  The Apache webserver is the world's most popular webserver, accounting
  for 68 % of the sites polled.

  Tcl/Tk is the powerful, free, cross-platform scripting language
  developed by Dr. John Ousterhout. In his own words

  "Tcl/Tk lets software developers get the job done ten times faster
  than with toolkits based on C or C++. It's also a great glue language
  for making existing applications work together and making them more
  graphical and Internet-aware."

  Karl Lehenbauer, Founder and Chief Technical Officer of NeoSoft, has
  been part of Tcl/Tk development from the very beginning.  Together
  with Mark Diehkans, they authored Extended Tcl, also known as TclX or
  NeoSoft Tcl, a powerful set of extensions to the language. Many of the
  current core Tcl commands originated in Extended Tcl, and were then
  imported into the core language by Dr.  Ousterhout.

  ·  Heitml secondary web site  <http://www.h-e-i.deom>

  heitml is a server side extension of HTML and a 4GL language at the
  same time. People can write web applications in the HTML style by
  using new HTML-like tags.

  heitml (pronounced "Hi"-TML) is an extension of HTML and a full-
  featured 4th generation language that enables Web-based Applications
  to interact with data stored in SQL databases, without resorting to
  complex CGI scripts.

  heitml extends HTML on the sever side, dynamically converting ".hei"
  files to HTML format and so is compatible with any web browser.It
  embraces the familiar, easy-to-use HTML syntax and provides a large
  assortment of pre-developed Tags and Libraries to take care of tasks
  that formerly required CGI. As XML, heitml provides user defined tags.
  With heitml the user defined markup can be translated to HTML and send
  to a browser.

  heitml targets both HTML designers and professional programmers alike.
  HTML designers can use heitml Tags to build dynamic web pages, access
  SQL databases, or create complete web applications. Counters,
  registration databases, search forms, email forms, or hierarchical
  menues can all be created simply by using the pre-developed HTML-like
  Tags found in the many Component Libraries.

  For programmers heitml embeds a complete forth generation language in
  HTML


                 (e.g. <if>, <while>, and <let> Tags),



  plus powerful expression evaluation with integer, real, boolean,
  string, and tuple data types. Tuples have reference semantics as in
  modern object oriented languages and are stored on a heap. heitml
  variables including all complex data structures stored on the heap
  maintain their values between pages using the Session Mode. It is pos­
  sible to define your own tags or environment tags and even re-define
  HTML-tags.

  heitml makes it possible to

  - - - develop Web Sites in a structured and modular way, drastically
  reducing maintenance overhead.

  - - - develop intelligent and interactive Web Sites, with content that
  dynamically adapts itself to user needs.

  - - - show the content of SQL databases with no programming other than
  to use our library of prefined "dba" Tags.

  - - - develop complex database and Catalog Shopping applications using
  Session Variables

  heitml runs on Linux with any Web Server using the CGI interface, and
  is especially fast (avoiding the CGI overhead) within the APACHE Web
  Server using the apache API. Currently MSQL (Version 1 and 2),
  PostgreSQL (Version 6), mysql, and the yard databases are supported).
  heitml also works on Linux, BSDi, Solaris and SunOS, as well as
  Windows NT with CGI and ISAPI and ODBC and Windows 95.

  heitml (on linux) is free for research, non-commercial and private
  usage. Commercial Web Sites must pay a licensing fee. The fully
  operational version of heitml is available for a trial period
  downloaded freely. (Note, however, that each ".hei" Web Page you
  develop will display a message identifying it as the version for non-
  commercial use. After registration, you will receive a key to switch
  off the message without having to re-install the program.)

  heitml (pronounced "Hi"-TML) significantly extends and enhances the
  functionality of HTML by definable tags and full programming features.
  This makes dynamic content and database applications possible simply
  within the HTML world, without CGI and without external scripting or
  programming languages.  This means you, as an HTML author, can embed
  applications in your web pages, simply by using some new tags without
  CGI and without programming. As an advanced user or programmer on the
  other hand you can create and program powerful tag libraries. This
  approach makes heitml suitable for HTML newcomers and professional
  programmers alike.  heitml runs on the web server and dynamically
  generates HTML, so heitml is compatible with the internet standards
  and with any web browser. It allows full access to databases while
  shielding the user from any unneccessary CGI complexity. heitml has
  been developed according to the newst research and in compiler
  construction and transaction systems.
  heitml pages are developed just the same way as HTML pages, with a
  text editor or HTML editor, and placed on the web server as usual.
  However now pages can contain dynamic heitml tags and access tag
  libraries.  You can use these tags to access the database, to create
  dynamic content, to send emails, and even to create powerful
  applications like registration databases and shopping systems.

  HTML newcomers and professional programmers alike will be amazed at
  how quickly and easily they can design exciting applications like our
  Interactive Guestbook without resorting to complex and difficult to
  learn CGI scripts, simply by using the tools provided in our dba
  Library.

  heitml is accompanied by a wide range of tag libraries, to create
  guestbooks, database maintenance applications, extensible query forms,
  powerful email forms or structure your web site using a hierarchic
  menu. These tools are ready to go, just add the corresponding tags to
  your web site.

  As an experienced programmer you can make fully use of the heitml
  persistent dynamic tuple architecture : heitml is not just a scripting
  language with dynamic typing, full power expression evaluation,
  recursive procedures and extensive parameter passing features, but it
  also features persistent dynamic tuples to automatically keep session
  data of any size.

  19.5.  America On-line AOL Web server for PostgreSQL

  The no-cost commercial webserver, AOLserver supports database
  connections to PostgreSQL for more information see

  ·  AOL Web Server home  <http://www.aolserver.com>

  ·  Introduction to AOLserver by Philip Greenspun
     <http://photo.net/wtr/aolserver/introduction-1.html>

     AOLserver is a fast, fully multithreaded, Tcl enabled webserver.
     But not only that, it is a complete database-backed web development
     platform.  With AOLserver you can have multiple pooled connections
     to PostgreSQL (and other RBDMSs) that can be shared among different
     threads. AOLserver has a Tcl and C APIs that allow you to develop
     powerful dynamic websites. All this since 1995. It is licensed
     under the APL (AOLserver Public License) or the GPL, thus being
     totally free software.  The Tcl API is the most useful for web
     sites. AOLserver has a set of powerful Tcl calls, such as
     ns_sendmail (to send e-mail), ns_httpget (to fetch an URL),
     ns_schedule (a cron-like feature to schedule procedures to run at
     specific times), etc. You can also extend AOLserver's capabilities
     very easily with the Tcl API. Each AOLserver virtual server can
     have its own "library" of private Tcl scripts that are parsed by
     AOLserver and become accessible to any page within that virtual
     server.  You can develop pages for AOLserver in three ways: - Plain
     HTML - .tcl pages -- these are tcl programs that can return HTML
     via the ns_write call.  - .adp pages -- AOL Dynamic Pages. You
     develop your pages in plain HTML but you can scape to Tcl code by
     using <% %> or <%= %> much alike PHP or ASP.  While AOLserver is a
     great webserver with a superb architecture, where it really shines
     is in database connectivity. AOLserver has its own database
     abstraction layer that enables you to have it connected to
     different RDBMSs without changing your code at all. The connections
     do the RDBMS are pooled, persistent and are shared among different
     threads.  This allows for very fast connections and efficient use
     of resources.  AOLserver has drivers for all major RDBMSs:
     PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Illustra, Solid, Interbase,
     MySQL.

  20.  Database Design Tool - Entity Relation Diagram Tool

  "DeZign for databases" (
  <http://www.heraut.demon.nl/dezign/index.html>) is a database
  development tool using an entity relationship diagram. It visually
  supports the lay out of the entities and relationships and
  automatically generates SQL-schemas for most leading databases.

  "DeZign for databases" supports the logical and physical data-level
  from a single specification achieved by using automatic foreign key
  migration at design-time. Multiple display options include
  entity/primary key/attributes inclusive foreign keys/attributes
  exclusive foreign keys.  "DeZign for databases" also supports domains
  (user defined datatypes).

  Reports generated by DeZign can be used for conveying complex designs
  in simplified format to managers at various management levels. You can
  generate reports, datadictionaries and databases by one simple click.
  The following databases are supported: Oracle, Interbase, IBM DB2,
  Sybase, MS Access (95/97/200), MS SQL Server, Paradox, dBase,
  Informix, SQL-Anywhere, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  21.  Web Database Design/Implementation tool for PostgreSQL - EARP


  ·  <http://www.oswego.edu/Earp>

  ·  <ftp://ftp.oswego.edu> in the directory 'pub/unix/earp'.

  21.1.  What is EARP ?

  The "Easily Adjustable Response Program" (EARP) created by David
  Dougherty.  EARP is a Web Database Design/Implementation tool, built
  on top of the PostgreSQL database system. Its functionality includes:


  ·  A Visual Design System.

  ·  A sendmail interface. (can handle incoming and outgoing mail)

  ·  An Enhanced Security Mechanism.

  ·  A cgi driver.

  21.2.  Implementation

  The main implementation of EARP is a CGI binary which runs under the
  http daemon to provide access to the database server. All of the
  design tools are built into the driver, no design takes place over
  anything but the web. The tools themselves require a graphical
  browser, the compatibility of objects designed with the tools is
  implementation independent, based on designing individuals
  preferences.

  21.3.  How does it work ?

  One of the main features of EARP is that it uses an Object Oriented
  approach to producing html pages which interface to the database. Most
  pages will consist of several objects. Each object is produced by some
  sort of tool and given a name, objects are then linked together in a
  callable sequence by the page tool. Objects are also reusable across
  multiple pages.  Basic tools exist for HTML, Querys, Grabbing input
  from forms, Extendable Formatting of Query and Input objects, and
  Linking together of objects into other objects. More advanced tools
  include the mail tool and the multithreaded query tool.

  Another feature of EARP is advanced security. Access to various areas
  of the EARP system can be limited in a variety of ways. To facilitate
  its advanced security, EARP performs checks for each connection to the
  system, determining what ids and groups the connecting agent belongs
  to. Access to areas is defined seperately, and the combination decides
  if access to a specific area of Earp is allowed. Moreover, all that is
  required to implement the security features is an http server that
  supports basic (or better) user authentication.

  21.4.  Where to get EARP ?

  EARP is available via anonymous ftp from

  ·  <ftp://ftp.oswego.edu> in the directory 'pub/unix/earp'.

  PHP is a server-side html-embedded scripting language. It lets you
  write simple scripts right in your .HTML files much like JavaScript
  does, except, unlike JavaScript PHP is not browser-dependant.
  JavaScript is a client-side html-embedded language while PHP is a
  server-side language.  PHP is similar in concept to Netscape's
  LiveWire Pro product.  If you like free fast-moving software that
  comes with full source code you will probably like PHP.


  ·  The PostgreSQL support code was written by Adam Sussman
     asussman@vidya.com

  22.1.  Major Features


  ·  Standard CGI, FastCGI and Apache module support - As a standard CGI
     program, PHP can be installed on any Unix machine running any Unix
     web server. With support for the new FastCGI standard, PHP can take
     advantage of the speed improvements gained through this mechanism.
     As an Apache module, PHP becomes an extremely powerful and
     lightning fast alternative to CGI programmimg.

  ·  Access Logging - With the access logging capabilities of PHP, users
     can maintain their own hit counting and logging. It does not use
     the system's central access log files in any way, and it provides
     real-time access monitoring. The Log Viewer Script provides a quick
     summary of the accesses to a set of pages owned by an individual
     user. In addition to that, the package can be configured to
     generate a footer on every page which shows access information. See
     the bottom of this page for an example of this.


  ·  Access Control - A built-in web-based configuration screen handles
     access control configuration. It is possible to create rules for
     all or some web pages owned by a certain person which place various
     restrictions on who can view these pages and how they will be
     viewed. Pages can be password protected, completely restricted,
     logging disabled and more based on the client's domain, browser, e-
     mail address or even the referring document.

  ·  PostgresSQL Support - Postgres is an advanced free RDBMS. PHP
     supports embedding PostgreSQL "SQL queries" directly in .html
     files.

  ·  RFC-1867 File Upload Support - File Upload is a new feature in
     Netscape 2.0. It lets users upload files to a web server. PHP
     provides the actual Mime decoding to make this work and also
     provides the additional framework to do something useful with the
     uploaded file once it has been received.

  ·  HTTP-based authentication control - PHP can be used to create
     customized HTTP-based authentication mechanisms for the Apache web
     server.

  ·  Variables, Arrays, Associative Arrays - PHP supports typed
     variables, arrays and even Perl-like associative arrays. These can
     all be passed from one web page to another using either GET or POST
     method forms.

  ·  Conditionals, While Loops - PHP supports a full-featured C-like
     scripting language.  You can have if/then/elseif/else/endif
     conditions as well as while loops and switch/case statements to
     guide the logical flow of how the html page should be displayed.

  ·  Extended Regular Expressions - Regular expressions are heavily used
     for pattern matching, pattern substitutions and general string
     manipulation. PHP supports all common regular expression
     operations.

  ·  Raw HTTP Header Control - The ability to have web pages send
     customized raw HTTP headers based on some condition is essential
     for high-level web site design. A frequent use is to send a
     Location: URL header to redirect the calling client to some other
     URL. It can also be used to turn off cacheing or manipulate the
     last update header of pages.

  ·  On-the-fly GIF image creation - PHP has support for Thomas
     Boutell's GD image library which makes it possible to generate GIF
     images on the fly.

  ·  ISP "Safe Mode" support - PHP supports an unique "Safe Mode" which
     makes it safe to have multiple users run PHP scripts on the same
     server.

  ·  Many more new features are being added in newer releases of PHP.
     Visit the main web site at  <http://www.php.net>

  ·  It's Free! - One final essential feature. The package is completely
     free.  It is licensed under the GNU/GPL which allows you to use the
     software for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.

  22.2.  PHP - Brief History

  PHP began life as a simple little cgi wrapper written in Perl.  The
  name of this first package was Personal Home Page Tools, which later
  became Personal Home Page Construction Kit.


  A tool was written to easily embed SQL queries into web pages. It was
  basically another CGI wrapper that parsed SQL queries and made it easy
  to create forms and tables based on these queries. This tool was named
  FI (Form Interpreter).

  PHP/FI version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of these two packages
  combined into a single program.  It evolved to a simple programming
  language embedded inside HTML files.  PHP eliminates the need for
  numerous small Perl cgi programs by allowing you to place simple
  scripts directly in your HTML files. This speeds up the overall
  performance of your web pages since the overhead of forking Perl
  several times has been eliminated.  It also makes it easier to manage
  large web sites by placing all components of a web page in a single
  html file.  By including support for various databases, it also makes
  it trivial to develop database enabled web pages. Many people find the
  embedded nature much easier to deal with than trying to create
  separate HTML and CGI files.

  Now PHP/FI is renamed as PHP.

  22.3.  So, what can I do with PHP ?

  The first thing you will notice if you run a page through PHP is that
  it adds a footer with information about the number of times your page
  has been accessed (if you have compiled access logging into the
  binary). This is just a very small part of what PHP can do for you. It
  serves another very important role as a form interpreter cgi, hence
  the FI part of the old name. For example, if you create a form on one
  of your web pages, you need something to process the information on
  that form. Even if you just want to pass the information to another
  web page, you will have to have a cgi program do this for you. PHP
  makes it extremely easy to take form data and do things with it.

  22.4.  A simple example

  Suppose you have a form:


       <FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/php.cgi/~userid/display.html" METHOD=POST>
       <INPUT TYPE="text" name="name">
       <INPUT TYPE="text" name="age">
       <INPUT TYPE="submit">
       <FORM>



  Your display.html file could then contain something like:


       < ?echo "Hi $ name, you are $ age years old!<p>" >



  It's that simple! PHP automatically creates a variable for each form
  input field in your form. You can then use these variables in the
  ACTION URL file.

  The next step once you have figured out how to use variables is to
  start playing with some logical flow tags in your pages. For example,
  if you wanted to display different messages based on something the
  user inputs, you would use if/else logic. In our above example, we can
  display different things based on the age the user entered by changing
  our display.html to:

  <?
      if($age>50);
          echo "Hi $name, you are ancient!<p>";
      elseif($age>30);
          echo "Hi $name, you are very old!<p>";
      else;
          echo "Hi $name.";
      endif;
  >



  PHP provides a very powerful scripting language which will do much
  more than what the above simple example demonstrates. See the section
  on the PHP Script Language for more information.

  You can also use PHP to configure who is allowed to access your pages.
  This is done using a built-in configuration screen. With this you
  could for example specify that only people from certain domains would
  be allowed to see your pages, or you could create a rule which would
  password protect certain pages. See the Access Control section for
  more details.

  PHP is also capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
  compliant web browser. This feature lets people upload both text and
  binary files. With PHP's access control and logical functions, you
  have full control over who is allowed to upload and what is to be done
  with the file once it has been uploaded. See the File Upload section
  for more details.

  PHP has support for the PostgreSQL database package. It supports
  embedded SQL queries in your .HTML files.

  PHP also has support for the mysql database package. It supports
  embedded SQL queries in your .HTML files.

  22.5.  CGI Redirection


  22.5.1.  Apache 1.0.x Notes

  A good way to run PHP is by using a cgi redirection module with the
  Apache server. Please note that you do not need to worry about
  redirection modules if you are using the Apache module version of PHP.
  There are two of these redirection modules available. One is developed
  by Dave Andersen

  ·  angio@aros.net

     and it is available at

  ·  <ftp://ftp.aros.net/pub/util/apache/mod_cgi_redirect.c>

     and the other comes bundled with Apache and is called
     mod_actions.c. The modules are extremely similar. They differ
     slightly in their usage. Both have been tested and both work with
     PHP.

  Check the Apache documentation on how to add a module. Generally you
  add the module name to a file called Configuration. The line to be
  added if you want to use the mod_actions module is:

  Module action_module mod_actions.o


  If you are using the mod_cgi_redirect.c module add this line:

  Module cgi_redirect_module mod_cgi_redirect.o

  Then compile your httpd and install it. To configure the cgi
  redirection you need to either create a new mime type in your
  mime.types file or you can use the AddType command in your srm.conf
  file to add the mime type. The mime type to be added should be
  something like this:


            application/x-httpd-php phtml



  If you are using the mod_actions.c module you need to add the follow­
  ing line to your srm.conf file:


            Action application/x-httpd-php /cgi-bin/php.cgi



  If you are using mod_cgi_redirect.c you should add this line to
  srm.conf:


            CgiRedirect application/x-httpd-php /cgi-bin/php.cgi



  Don't try to use both mod_actions.c and mod_cgi_redirect.c at the same
  time.

  Once you have one of these cgi redirection modules installed and
  configured correctly, you will be able to specify that you want a file
  parsed by PHP simply by making the file's extension .phtml.
  Furthermore, if you add index.phtml to your DirectoryIndex
  configuration line in your srm.conf file then the top-level page in a
  directory will be automatically parsed by php if your index file is
  called index.phtml.

  22.5.2.  Netscape HTTPD

  You can automatically redirect requests for files with a given
  extension to be handled by PHP by using the Netscape Server CGI
  Redirection module. This module is available in the File Archives on
  the PHP Home Page. The README in the package explicitly explains how
  to configure it for use with PHP.

  22.5.3.  NCSA HTTPD

  NCSA does not currently support modules, so in order to do cgi
  redirection with this server you need to modify your server source
  code. A patch to do this with NCSA 1.5 is available in the PHP file
  archives.

  22.6.  Running PHP from the command line

  If you build the CGI version of PHP, you can use it from the command
  line simply typing: php.cgi filename where filename is the file you
  want to parse. You can also create standalone PHP scripts by making
  the first line of your script look something like:
           #!/usr/local/bin/php.cgi -q



  The "-q" suppresses the printing of the HTTP headers. You can leave
  off this option if you like.

  22.7.  PHPGem package

  PHPGem is a PHP-script which accelerates the creation of PHP-scripts
  for working with tables. It works with different SQL-servers such as
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, mSQL, ODBC, and Adabas. You input a description of
  and parameters for your tables' fields (field name, on/off searching
  in the field, etc.), and PHPGem outputs another PHP-script which will
  work with the tables (view/add/edit/delete/duplicate entries and
  search). PHPGem works with multi-level nested tables. PHPGem allows
  you to specify a level of access for each table and for each field for
  each user. PHPGem also support images.

  PHPGem is at  <http://sptl.org/phpgem>

  23.  Python Interface for PostgreSQL

  Python in an interpreted, object orientated scripting language.  It is
  simple to use (light syntax, simple and straighforward statements),
  and has many extensions for building GUIs, interfacing with WWW, etc.
  An intelligent web browser (HotJava like) is currently under
  development (november 1995), and this should open programmers many
  doors. Python is copyrighted by Stichting S Mathematisch Centrum,
  Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is freely distributable.  It contains
  support for dynamic loading of objects, classes, modules, and
  exceptions.  Adding interfaces to new system libraries through C code
  is straightforward, making Python easy to use in custom settings.
  Python is a very high level scripting language with X interface.
  Python package is distributed on Linux cdroms includes most of the
  standard Python modules, along with modules for interfacing to the Tix
  widget set for Tk.

  PyGreSQL is a python module that interfaces to a PostgreSQL database.
  It embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow easy use of the
  powerful PostgreSQL features from a Python script.  PyGreSQL is
  written by D'Arcy J.M. Cain and Pascal Andre.

  23.3.  Testing Python interface

  See the section - ``Testing Python PostgreSQL interface''

  24.  Gateway between PostgreSQL and the WWW - WDB-P95


  24.1.  About wdb-p95

  WDB-P95 - A Web interface to PostgreSQL Databases was created by J.
  Douglas Dunlop It is at

  ·  New WDB from J Rowe is at
     <http://www.lava.net/beowulf/programming/wdb>

  ·  New versions of WWW-WDB is at  <http://www.eol.ists.ca/~dunlop/wdb-
     p95/>

  ·  For questions or to join Mailing lists contact dunlop@eol.ists.ca

     This is a modified version of wdb-1.3a2 which provides a gateway to
     a the WWW for PostgreSQL. This version also requires a Browser that
     is capable of handling HTML Tables for the tabular output. This is
     not required by the original wdb and can be fairly easily reverted.

  You can try out CASI Tape and Image Query. You can have a peek at the
  Form Definition File (FDF) which is used to create the CASI Tape and
  Image Query too, which includes a JOIN of 2 tables.

  This release contains all files necessary to install and run WDB-P95
  as an interface to your PostgreSQL databases. To port this system to
  other database should be relatively easy - provided that it supports
  standard SQL and has a Perl interface.

  24.2.  Does the PostgreSQL server, pgperl, and httpd have to be on the
  same host?

  No - the PostgreSQL server does not have to be on the same host. As
  WDB-P95 is called by the http daemon, they have to be on the same
  host. - And as WDB-P95 was written to use Pg.pm - pgperl has to be on
  the same host too.  Pgperl was written using the libpq library, so it
  will be able to access any PostgreSQL server anywhere in the net, just
  like any other PostgreSQL client. As illustrated below

  (WWW Client (Netscape)) => (HTTP Server (NCSA's http) + WDB-P95 +
  pgperl + libpq)=> (PostgreSQL server)

  Curly brackets () represent machines.

  Each machine can be of a different type : NT, SUN, HP, ... but you
  need the libpq interface library for the machine type where you plan
  to use WDB-P95, as you need it to compile pgperl. (The system was
  designed to use HTML tables so a recent WWW client is best)

  25.  "C", "C++", ESQL/C language Interfaces and Bitwise Operators for
  PostgreSQL


  25.1.  "C" interface

  It is included in distribution and is called 'libpq'. Similar to
  Oracle OCI, Sybase DB-lib, Informix CLI libraries.


  25.2.  "C++" interface

  It is included in distribution and is called 'libpq++'.  See the
  section - ``Testing C and C++ PostgreSQL interface''

  25.3.  ESQL/C

  ESQL/C 'Embedded C Pre-compiler' for PostgreSQL ESQL/C is like Oracle
  Pro*C, Informix ESQL/C.  The PostgreSQL ESQL/C is an SQL application-
  programming interface (API) enables the C programmer to create custom
  applications with database-management capabilities. The PostgreSQL
  ESQL/C allows you to use a third-generation language with which you
  are familiar and still take advantage of the Structured Query Language
  (SQL).

  ESQL/C consists of the following pieces of software:

  ·  The ESQL/C libraries of C functions provide access to the database
     server.

  ·  The ESQL/C header files provide definitions for the data
     structures, constants, and macros useful to the ESQL/C program.

  ·  The ESQL/C preprocessor, is a source-code preprocessor that
     converts a C file containing SQL statements into an executable
     file.

     It is at

  ·  ESQL/C for PostgreSQL is already included in the distribution.

  ·  Main site  <ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/linus>

  ·  Email : linus@epact.se

     See the section - ``Testing Embedded SQL/C interface to
     PostgreSQL''

  To use Vim color editor to edit 'ecpg' files (*.pgc), you must do the
  following:-

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - postgres
  bash$ mkdir $HOME/vim
  And create a file '$HOME/vim/myfilestypes.vim' which has these lines

      " myfiletypefile
          au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.pgc    set filetype=esqlc
  ______________________________________________________________________


  You should have $HOME/.gvimrc file. If not create one, refer to Vim
  howto doc at <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Vim-HOWTO.html> Put the
  following line in $HOME/.gvimrc file

  ______________________________________________________________________
  let myfiletypefile = "~/vim/myfiletypes.vim"
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Now, if you edit with

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ gvim sample.pgc
  ______________________________________________________________________


  you will get the color syntax highlighted.

  25.4.  BitWise Operators for PostgreSQL

  Bitwise operators was written by Nicolas Moldavsky

  ·  nico@overnet.com.ar

     "C" functions that implement bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, bit
     complement) on pgsql. Get them by anonymous FTP from

  ·  <ftp://ftp.overnet.com.ar/pub/utils/linux/bitpgsql.tgz>

     Makefile for Linux is included.

  26.  Japanese Kanji Code for PostgreSQL

  It is at the following site

  ·  <ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/cmd/postgres/>

  27.  PostgreSQL Port to Windows 95/Windows NT

  PostgreSQL binaries for Windows NT is available from :

  ·  Windows NT PostgreSQL binaries  <http://www.askesis.nl>

  ·  <http://www.postgresql.org>

     Download the binaries and unpack and follow instructions in
     ``Install PostgreSQL'' from step 13.

  If you want to re-compile the source tree then follow the instructions
  given below.  Porting to NT is done using Cygnus cygwin32 package
  which has gcc, gmake for Win NT/95.

  ·  Cygwin 32 package is at  <http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32>

     At this site and get the file cdk.exe (self-extractor file for gnu-
     win32)

  27.1.  Authors of NT port

  The authors of Windows NT port of PostgreSQL are -

  ·  Daniel Horak horak@mmp.plzen-city.cz

  ·  Joost Kraaijeveld JKraaijeveld@askesis.nl

  ·  Kevin Lo kevlo@FreeBSD.org

  ·  Home page of NT port is at
     <http://www.freebsd.org/~kevlo/postgres/portNT.html>

  27.2.  Install the Cygwin package


  1. Download
     <ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/latest/full.exe>

  2. Run full.exe and install in c:\Unix\Root directory.

  3. Run Cygwin, Type 'mount --help' for docs. You can use -f switch to
     force mount.  And then run "umount / " and "mount c:\Unix\Root /"

  27.3.  Tuneup Bash Window

  After installing the Cygwin package, do the following to setup the
  working environment:

  1. Install the Vi editor 'Vim'. See
  <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Vim-HOWTO.html>

  2. The default window of cygwin bash is black-background window with
  24 lines. To set the background color and size of bash window, click
  on NT-Start->Control-panel->MS DOS console and change the background
  color to grey and size to 70 lines.

  (OR) right click on Window titlebar and change property.

  3. Edit cygnus.bat in c:\cygnus\cywinb20 and set the following -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  set HOME=c:\cygnus\cygwinb20
  bash --login
  ______________________________________________________________________



  And also edit the  /.bash_profile and put these lines

  ______________________________________________________________________
  set -o vi
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
  export PATH
  ______________________________________________________________________


  4. To enable the command-line history editing give -

  bash$ set -o vi

  Using the l,k,j,h you can use the vi commands to edit the command line
  history commands. You can repeat or modify previous commands, saves
  typing time.

  5. You can do mount of drives/directories using this command -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ umount /
  bash$ mount "c:\cygnus"  /
  bash$ mount "c:\cygnus\cygwin-b20\postgres" /usr/local/pgsql
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6. See online help with -

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ mount --help
  bash$ ls --help
  ______________________________________________________________________



  27.4.  Install the Andy Piper tools


  1. Go to  <ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/> and download cygwin-
     b20-local.tar.bz2 in the c:/Unix/Root directory.

  2. cd c:/Unix/Root; bunzip2 cygwin-b20-local.tar.bz2

  3. tar -xvf cygwin-b20-local.tar

  4. cd /local/bin; sh check_cygwin_setup.sh

  5. After doing step 4, you see the following message:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     You don't have /bin would you like to mount cygwin as /bin?"
     [ y/n ]
     Select 'n',  and the other options are selected 'y'
     ___________________________________________________________________



  6. mount c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32/bin
     /bin

  7. cd c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32; mkdir
     libexec share man etc sbin info

  8. cp -R /local/{ bin,libexec,share,man,etc,sbin,info,include }

  27.5.  Install Ludovic Lange's Cygwin32 IPC package


  1. Go to  <http://www.multione.capgemini.fr/tools/pack_ipc> and
     download cygwin32_ipc-1.03.tgz in c:/Unix/Root directory.

  2. tar -zxvf cygwin32_ipc-1.03.tgz


  3. cd cygwin32_ipc-1.03/src and run 'make'

  4. mkdir -p c:/usr/local/{bin,include,lib,include/sys}

     ___________________________________________________________________
     cp /cygwin32_ipc-1.03/bin/* c:/usr/local/bin
     cp /cygwin32_ipc-1.03/include/sys/* c:/usr/local/include/sys
     cp /cygwin32_ipc-1.03/lib/* c:/usr/local/lib
     cp c:/usr/local/bin/* /bin
     cp c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin/* /bin
     ___________________________________________________________________



  5. mount c:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

     ___________________________________________________________________
     mount c:/usr/local/include /usr/local/include
     mount c:/usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib
     cp /local/lib/* /usr/local/lib
     ___________________________________________________________________



  27.6.  Install PostgreSQL


  1. Download the latest PostgreSQL source code

  2. Postgres treats all files as binary files so the lf/cf stuff
     appeard, so we do steps 2, 3, 4, and 5:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     mkdir -p c:/Postgres/{Source,Binary}
     mkdir c:/Postgres/Binary/pgsql
     mkdir -p /usr/src/pgsql
     mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql
     ___________________________________________________________________



  3. Copy Postgres source code to c:/Postgres/Source directory, then tar
     -zxvf postgresql-6.5.3.tar.gz

  4. mv postgresql-6.5.3 pgsql

  5. Mount directories now -

     ___________________________________________________________________
     mount -b c:/Postgres/Binary/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql
     mount c:/Postgres/Source/pgsql /usr/src/pgsql
     mount c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/share /sw/cygwin-b20/share
     ___________________________________________________________________



  6. mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql/{bin,include,lib,data}

  7. cd /usr/src/pgsql/src/win32

  8. Copy header files -



     ___________________________________________________________________
     cp un.h c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32/include/sys
     cp endian.h c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32/include
     cp tcp.h c:/Unix/Root/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32/include/netinet
     ___________________________________________________________________



  9. ln -s /usr/local/lib /usr/src/pgsql/src/backend/libpostgres.a

  10.
     cd /usr/src/pgsql/src, then run './configure'

  11.
     make > make.txt 2>&1

  12.
     make install  > make.install.txt 2>&1

  13.
     cp /usr/local/pgsql/lib/pq.dll /usr/local/pgsql/bin

  14.
     After the make install you had to change all the text files in the
     bin and lib diectories so that they did not contain cr/lf and eof
     stuff.

  15.
     Using any editor to create .bashrc in / directory as belows:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin:/usr/local/bin
     PGDATA=/usr/local/pgsql/data
     PGLIB=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib:/usr/local/lib
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH PGDATA PGLIB
     ___________________________________________________________________



  16.
     source /.bashrc, then run 'initdb --username=xxxx' Note that the
     owner of the DB system have to be different from root/administrator

  17.
     Edit the file /usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf, such as:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     host        all     163.17.11.109   255.255.255.0   trust
     ___________________________________________________________________



  18.

  designated TSQL2.

  The language specification present here is the final version of the
  language.

  committees.

  Associated with the language specification is a collection of
  commentaries which discuss design decisions, provide examples, and
  consider how the language may be implemented. These commentaries were
  originally proposals to the TSQL2 Language Design Committee. They now
  serve a different purpose: to provide examples of the constructs,
  motivate the many decisions made during the language design, and
  compare TSQL2 with the many other language proposals that have been
  made over the last fifteen years. It should be emphasized that these
  commentaries are not part of the TSQL2 language specification per se,
  but rather supplement and elaborate upon it. The language
  specification proper is the final word on TSQL2.

  The commentaries, along with the language specification, several
  indexes, and other supporting material, has been published as a book:

  Academic Publishers, 1995, 674+xxiv pages.

  29.9.  Part 0 - Acquiring ISO/ANSI SQL Documents

  This document shows you how to (legally) acquire a copy of the SQL-92
  standard and how to acquire a copy of the "current" SQL3 Working
  Draft.

  The standard is copyrighted ANSI standard by ANSI, the ISO standard by
  ISO.

  There are two (2) current SQL standards, an ANSI publication and an
  ISO publication. The two standards are word-for-word identical except
  for such trivial matters as the title of the document, page headers,
  the phrase "International Standard" vs "American Standard", and so
  forth.

  Buying the SQL-92 Standard

  The ISO standard, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Information Technology - Database
  Languages - SQL, is currently (March, 1993) available and in stock
  from ANSI at:


            American National Standards Institute
            1430 Broadway
            New York, NY 10018 (USA)
            Phone (sales): +1.212.642.4900



  at a cost of US$230.00. The ANSI version, ANSI X3.135-1992, American
  National Standard for Information Systems - Database Language SQL, was
  not available from stock at this writing, but was expected to be
  available by some time between late March and early May, 1993). It is
  expected to be be priced at US$225.00.

  If you purchase either document from ANSI, it will have a handling
  charge of 7% added to it (that is, about US$9.10). Overseas shipping
  charges will undoubtedly add still more cost. ANSI requires a hardcopy
  of a company purchase order to accompany all orders; alternately, you
  can send a check drawn on an US bank in US dollars, which they will
  cash and clear before shipping your order. (An exception exists: If
  your organization is a corporate member of ANSI, then ANSI will ship
  the documents and simply bill your company.)

  The ISO standard is also available outside the United States from
  local national bodies (country standardization bodies) that are
  members of either ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
  or IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission). Copies of the list
  of national bodies and their addresses are available from ANSI or from
  other national bodies. They are also available from ISO:



       International Organization for Standardization
       Central Secretariat
       1, rue de Varembi
       CH-1211 Genhve 20
       Switzerland



  If you prefer to order the standard in a more convenient and quick
  fashion, you'll have to pay for the privilege. You can order ISO/IEC
  9075:1992, Information Technology - Database Languages - SQL, from:


            Global Engineering Documents
            2805 McGaw Ave
            Irvine, CA 92714 (USA)
            USA
            Phone (works from anywhere): +1.714.261.1455
            Phone (only in the USA): (800)854-7179



  for a cost of US$308.00. I do not know if that includes shipping or
  not, but I would guess that international shipping (at least) would
  cost extra. They will be able to ship you a document fairly quickly
  and will even accept "major credit cards". Global does not yet have
  the ANSI version nor do they have a price or an expected date (though
  I would expect it within a few weeks following the publication by ANSI
  and at a price near US$300.00).

  Buying a copy of the SQL3 Working Draft

  You can purchase a hardcopy of the SQL3 working draft from the ANSI X3
  Secretariat, CBEMA (Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
  Association). They intend to keep the "most recent" versions of the
  SQL3 working draft available and sell them for about US$60.00 to
  US$65.00.  You can contact CBEMA at:


            CBEMA, X3 Secretariat
            Attn: Lynn Barra
            1250 Eye St.
            Suite 200
            Washington, DC 20005 (USA)



  Lynn Barra can also be reached by telephone at +1.202.626.5738 to
  request a copy, though mail is probably more courteous.

  Electronic Access to the SQL3 Working Draft

  The most recent version (as of the date of this writing) of the SQL3
  (both ANSI and ISO) working draft (and all of its Parts) is available
  by "anonymous ftp" or by "ftpmail" on:


            gatekeeper.dec.com

         at

            /pub/standards/sql/

  In this directory are a number of files.  There are PostScript. files
  and "plain text" (not prettily formatted, but readable on a screen
  without special software).

  In general, you can find files with names like:


            sql-bindings-mar94.ps
            sql-bindings-mar94.txt
            sql-cli-mar94.ps
            sql-cli-mar94.txt
            sql-foundation-mar94.ps
            sql-foundation-mar94.txt
            sql-framework-mar94.ps
            sql-framework-mar94.txt
            sql-psm-mar94.ps
            sql-psm-mar94.txt



  As new versions of the documents are produced, the "mar94" will change
  to indicate the new date of publication (e.g., "aug94" is the expected
  date of the next publication after "mar94").

  In addition, for those readers unable to get a directory listing by
  FTP, we have placed a file with the name:


            ls



  into the same directory.  This file (surprise!) contains a directory
  listing of the directory.

  Retrieving Files Directly Using ftp

  This is a sample of how to use FTP. Specifically, it shows how to
  connect to gatekeeper.dec.com, get to the directory where the base
  document is kept, and transfer the document to your host. Note that
  your host must have Internet access to do this. The login is 'ftp' and
  the password is your email address (this is sometimes referred to as
  bits are stripped from the file(s) received. 'get' gets one file at a
  time. Comments in the script below are inside angle brackets < like so
  > .



    % ftp gatekeeper.dec.com

  Retrieving Files Without Direct ftp Support

  Digital Equipment Corporation, like several other companies, provides
  ftp email service. The response can take several days, but it does
  provide a service equivalent to ftp for those without direct Internet
  ftp access. The address of the server is:

  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

  The following script will retrieve the PostScript for the latest
  version of the SQL3 document:


            reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
            connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
            binary
            compress



  The following script will retrieve the PostScript for the latest ver­
  sion of the SQL3 document:



       reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
       connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
       binary
       compress
       uuencode
       chdir /pub/standards/sql
       get x3h2-93-091.ps
       quit



  The first line in the script commands the server to return the
  requested files to you; you should replace "joe.programmer@imaginary-
  corp.com" with your Internet address. The file in this example,
  x3h2-93-091.ps, is returned in "compress"ed "uuencode"d format as 34
  separate email messages. If your environment does not provide tools
  for reconstructing such files, then you could retrieve the file as
  plain text with the following script:


            reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
            connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
            chdir /pub/standards/sql
            get x3h2-93-091.ps
            quit



  But be warned, the .ps file will probably be sent to you in more than
  70 parts!

  To retrieve any particular file, other than x3h2-93-091.ps, simply
  replace "x3h2-93-091.ps" with the name of the desired file. To get a
  directory listing of all files available, replace "get x3h2-93-091.ps"
  with "dir".

  29.10.  Part 1 - ISO/ANSI SQL Current Status

  This chapter is a source of information about the SQL standards
  process and its current state.

  Current Status:

  Development is currently underway to enhance SQL into a
  computationally complete language for the definition and management of
  persistent, complex objects. This includes: generalization and
  specialization hierarchies, multiple inheritance, user defined data
  types, triggers and assertions, support for knowledge based systems,
  recursive query expressions, and additional data administration tools.
  It also includes the specification of abstract data types (ADTs),
  object identifiers, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation,
  and all of the other facilities normally associated with object data
  management.

  In the fall of 1996, several parts of SQL3 went through an ISO CD
  ballot.  Those parts were SQL/Framework, SQL/Foundation, and
  SQL/Bindings. Those ballots failed (as expected) with 900 or so
  comments. In Late January, there was an ISO DBL editing meeting that
  processed a large number of problem solutions that were either
  included with ballot comments or submitted as separate papers. Since
  the DBL editing meeting was unable to process all of the comments, the
  editing meeting has been extended. The completion of the editing
  meeting is scheduled for the end of July, 1997, in London.

  Following the July editing meeting, the expectation is that a Final CD
  ballot will be requested for these parts of SQL. The Final CD process
  will take about 6 months and a DBL editing meeting, after which there
  will be a DIS ballot and a fairly quick IS ballot.

  The ISO procedures have changed since SQL/92, so the SQL committees
  are still working through the exact details of the process.

  If everything goes well, these parts of SQL3 will become an official
  ISO/IEC standard in late 1998, but the schedule is very tight.

  In 1993, the ANSI and ISO development committees decided to split
  future SQL development into a multi-part standard. The Parts are:


  ·  Part 1: Framework A non-technical description of how the document
     is structured.

  ·  Part 2: Foundation The core specification, including all of the new
     ADT features.

  ·  Part 3: SQL/CLI The Call Level Interface.

  ·  Part 4: SQL/PSM The stored procedures specification, including
     computational completeness.

  ·  Part 5: SQL/Bindings The Dynamic SQL and Embedded SQL bindings
     taken from SQL-92.

  ·  Part 6: SQL/XA An SQL specialization of the popular XA Interface
     developed by X/Open

  ·  Part 7:SQL/TemporalAdds time related capabilities to the SQL
     standards.

  In the USA, the entirety of SQL3 is being processed as both an ANSI
  Domestic ("D") project and as an ISO project. The expected time frame
  for completion of SQL3 is currently 1999.

  The SQL/CLI and SQL/PSM are being processed as fast as possible as
  addendums to SQL-92. In the USA, these are being processed only as
  International ("I") projects. SQL/CLI was completed in 1995. SQL/PSM
  should be completed sometime in late 1996.

  In addition to the SQL3 work, a number of additional projects are
  being persued:


  ·  SQL/MM An ongoing effort to define standard multi-media packages
     using the SQL3 ADT capabilities.

  ·  Remote Data Access (RDA)

  Standards Committee and Process

  There are actually a number of SQL standards committees around the
  world.  There is an international SQL standards group as a part of
  ISO. A number of countries have committees that focus on SQL. These
  countries (usually) send representatives to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 21/WG3 DBL
  meetings. The countries that actively participate in the ISO SQL
  standards process are:


  ·  Australia


  ·  Brazil

  ·  Canada

  ·  France

  ·  Germany

  ·  Japan

  ·  Korea

  ·  The Netherlands

  ·  United Kingdom

  ·  United States

  NIST Validation

  SQL implementations are validated (in the Unites States) by the
  National Institute of Standards and Training (NIST). NIST currently
  has a validation test suite for entry level SQL-92. The exact details
  of the NIST validation requirements are defined as a Federal
  Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The current requirements for
  SQL are defined in FIPS 127-2. The Postscript and Text versions of
  this document can be retrieved from NIST.  The current SQL Validated
  Products List can also be retrieved from NIST.

  Standard SQL Publications and Articles

  There are two versions of the SQL standard. Both are available from
  ANSI:


  ·  ISO/IEC 9075:1992, "Information Technology --- Database Languages
     --- SQL"

  ·  ANSI X3.135-1992, "Database Language SQL"

  The two versions of the SQL standard are identical except for the
  front matter and references to other standards. Both versions are
  available from:


            American National Standards Institute
            1430 Broadway
            New York, NY 10018
            USA
            Phone (sales): +1.212.642.4900



  In additon to the SQL-92 standard, there is now a Technical Corrigen­
  dum (bug fixes):


          * Technical Corrigendum 1:1994 to ISO/IEC 9075:1992



  TC 1 should also be available from ANSI. There is only an ISO version
  of TC 1 -- it applies both to the ISO and ANSI versions of SQL-92.

  In addition to the standards, several books have been written about
  the 1992 SQL standard. These books provide a much more readable
  description of the standard than the actual standard.

  Related Standards

  A number of other standards are of interest to the SQL community. This
  section contains pointers to information on those efforts. These
  pointers will be augmented as additional information becomes available
  on the web.


  ·  SQL Environments (FIPS 193)

  ·  Next Generation Repository Systems (X3H4) - a News Release calling
     for particpation in "Developing Standards for the Next Generation
     Repository Systems."

  29.11.  Part 2 - ISO/ANSI SQL Foundation

  A significant portion of the SQL3 effort is in the SQL Foundation
  document:


  ·  Base SQL/PSM capabilities (moved form SQL/PSM-92)

  ·  New data types

  ·  Triggers

  ·  Subtables

  ·  Abstract Data Types (ADT)

  ·  Object Oriented Capabilities

  There are several prerequisites to the object oriented capabilities:


  ·  Capability of defining complex operations

  ·  Store complex operations in the database

  ·  External procedure calls ­ Some operations may not be in SQL, or
     may require external interactions

  These capabilities are defined as a part of SQL/PSM

  A great deal of work is currently being done to refine the SQL-3
  object model and align it with the object model proposed by ODMG. This
  effort is described in the X3H2 and ISO DBL paper: Accomodating SQL3
  and ODMG. A recent update on the SQL3/OQL Merger is also available.

  SQL3 Timing

  Work on SQL3 is well underway, but the final standards is several
  years away.


  ·  International ballot to progress SQL3 Foundation from Working Draft
     to Committee Draft (CD) taking place fall, 1996.

  ·  Ballot is expected to generate numerous comments

  ·  A second CD ballot is likely to be required

  ·  Draft International Standard ballot is likely to be take place in
     mid 1998

  ·  International Standard could be completed by mid 1999.

  The ANSI version of the standard will be on a similar schedule.

  29.12.  Part 3 - ISO/ANSI SQL Call Level Interface

  The SQL/CLI is a programing call level interface to SQL databases. It
  is designed to support database access from shrink-wrapped
  applications. The CLI was originally created by a subcommittee of the
  SQL Access Group (SAG).  The SAG/CLI specification was published as
  the Microsoft Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) specification in 1992.
  In 1993, SAG submitted the CLI to the ANSI and ISO SQL committees.
  (The SQL Access Group has now merged with X/Open consortium.)

  SQL/CLI provides an international standard for:


  ·  Implementation-independent CLI to access SQL databases

  ·  Client-server tools can easily access database through dynamic Link
     Libraries

  ·  Supports and encourages rich set of Client-server tools

  SQL/CLI Timing

  For the standards process, SQL/CLI is being processed with blinding
  speed.


  ·  SQL/CLI is an addendum to 1992 SQL standard (SQL-92)

  ·  Completed as an ISO standard in 1995

  ·  ISO/IEC 9075-3:1995 Information technology -- Database languages --
     SQL -- Part 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI)

  ·  Current SQL/CLI effort is adding support for SQL3 features

  29.13.  Part 4 - ISO/ANSI SQL Persistent Stored Modules

  SQL/PSM expands SQL by adding:


  ·  Procedural language extensions

  ·  Multi-statement and Stored Procedures

  ·  External function and procedure calls

  In addition to being a valuable application development tool, SQL/PSM
  provides the foundation support for the object oriented capabilities
  in SQL3.

  Multi-statement and Stored Procedures

  Multi-statement and stored procedures offer a variety of advantages in
  a client/server environment:


  ·  Performance - Since a stored procedure can perform multiple SQL
     statements, network interaction with the client are reduced.

  ·  Security - An user can be given the right to call a stored
     procedure that updates a table or set of tables but denied the
     right to update the tables directly

  ·  Shared code - The code in a stored procedure does not have to be
     rewritten and retested for each client tool that accesses the
     database.

  ·  Control - Provides a single point of definition and control for
     application logic.

  Procedural Language Extensions

  Procedural language add the power of a traditional programming
  language to SQL through flow control statements and a variety of other
  programming constructs.

  Flow Control Statements


  ·  If-then-else

  ·  Looping constructs

  ·  Exception handling

  ·  Case statement

  ·  Begin-End blocks

  The procedural language extensions include other programming language
  constructs:


  ·  Variable declarations

  ·  Set statements for value assignment

  ·  Get diagnostics for process and status information

  In addition, all of the traditional SQL statements can be included in
  multi-statement procedures.

  External Procedure and Function Calls

  One feature frequently mentioned in the wish lists for many database
  products, and implemented in some, is a capability augmenting the
  built-in features with calls to user-written procedures external to
  the database software.


  ·  Allows a particular site or application to add their own database
     functions

  ·  Can be used throughout the database applications

  The benefit of this capability is that it gives the database (and
  therefore database applications) access to a rich set of procedures
  and functions too numerous to be defined by a standards committee.

  SQL/PSM Timing

  SQL/PSM is proceeding quickly:



  ·  SQL/PSM is an addendum to SQL-92

  ·  International ballot to progress SQL/PSM from a Draft International
     Standard to an International Standard ended January, 1996.

  ·  Editing meeting in May, 1996 did not resolve all of the comments

  ·  Continuation of PSM Editing meeting is scheduled for September 30
     through October 4, 1996

  ·  The schedule is tight but there is a chance that PSM will be
     published with a 1996 date.

  ·  The official designation will be: ISO/IEC DIS 9075-4:199?
     Information technology -- Database languages -- SQL -- Part 4: SQL
     Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)

  ·  Work is well underway on adding SQL/PSM support for SQL3 features.

  29.14.  Part 5 - ISO/ANSI SQL/Bindings

  For ease of reference, the programming language bindings have been
  pulled out into a separate document. The current version is simply an
  extract of the dynamic and embedded bindings from SQL-92.

  A variety of issues remain unresolved for the programming language
  bindings.

  For traditional programming language, mappings exist for the SQL-92
  datatypes. However, mappings must be defined between SQL objects and
  programming language variables.

  For object oriented languages, mapping must be defined for the current
  SQL datatypes and between the SQL object model and the object model of
  the object-oriented language.

  The object model needs to stabilize before these can be addressed.

  The language bindings will be completed as a part of SQL3.

  29.15.  Part 6 - ISO/ANSI SQL XA Interface Specialization (SQL/XA)

  This specification would standardize an application program interface
  (API) between a global Transaction Manager and an SQL Resource
  Manager. It would standardize the function calls, based upon the
  semantics of ISO/IEC 10026, "Distributed Transaction Processing", that
  an SQL Resource Manager would have to support for two-phase commit.
  The base document is derived from an X/Open publication, with X/Open
  permission, that specifies explicit input and output parameters and
  semantics, in terms of SQL data types, for the following functions:
  xa_close, xa_commit, xa_complete, xa_end, xa_forget, xa_open,
  xa_prepare, xa_recover, xa_rollback, and xa_start.

  ISO is currently attempting to fast-track the X/Open XA specification.
  The fast-track process adopts a current industry specification with no
  changes.  The XA fast-track ballot at the ISO SC21, JTC 1 level
  started on April 27, 1995 and ends on October 27, 1995. If the XA
  specification is approved by 75% of the votes, and by 2/3 of the p-
  members of JTC 1, it will become an International Standard. If the
  fast-track ballot is approved, SQL/XA could become a standard in 1996.

  29.16.  Part 7 - ISO/ANSI SQL Temporal

  Temporal SQL deals with time-related data. The concept is that it is
  useful to query data to discover what it looked like at a particular
  point in time.  Temporal SQL is a December, 1994 paper by Rick
  Snodgrass describing the concepts.

                                       Temporal SQL
                                       ************
       Rick Snodgrass (chair of the TSQL2 committee)
       31-Dec-1994



  Several people have questioned the need for additional support for
  time in SQL3 (as proposed by DBL RIO-75, requesting a new part of SQL
  to support temporal databases). The claim is that abstract data types
  (ADT's) are sufficient for temporal support. In this informational
  item, I argue, using concrete examples, that using columns typed with
  abstract data types is inadequate for temporal queries. In particular,
  many common temporal queries are either difficult to simulate in SQL,
  or require embedding SQL in a procedural language. Alternatives are
  expressed in TSQL2, a temporal extension to SQL-92.

  29.16.1.  INTRODUCTION

  Valid-time support goes beyond that of a temporal ADT. With the later,
  a column is specified as of a temporal domain, such as DATE or
  INTERVAL (examples will be given shortly). With valid time, the rows
  of a table vary over time, as reality changes. The timestamp
  associated with a row of a valid-time table is interpreted by the
  query language as the time when the combination of values of the
  columns in the row was valid. This implicit timestamp allows queries
  to be expressed succinctly and intuitively.

  29.16.2.  A CASE STUDY - STORING CURRENT INFORMATION

  The University of Arizona's Office of Appointed Personnel has some
  information in a database, including each employee's name, their
  current salary, and their current title. This can be represented by a
  simple table.


               Employee(Name, Salary, Title)



  Given this table, finding an employee's salary is easy.


               SELECT Salary
               FROM Employee
               WHERE Name = 'Bob'



  Now the OAP wishes to record the date of birth. To do so, a column is
  added to the table, yielding the following schema.


               Employee(Name, Salary, Title, DateofBirth DATE)


  Finding the employee's date of birth is analogous to determining the
  salary.


               SELECT DateofBirth
               FROM Employee
               WHERE Name = 'Bob'



  29.16.3.  A CASE STUDY - STORING HISTORY INFORMATION

  The OAP wishes to computerize the employment history. To do so, they
  append two columns, one indicating when the information in the row
  became valid, the other indicating when the information was no longer
  valid.

  Employee (Name, Salary, Title, DateofBirth, Start DATE, Stop DATE)

  To the data model, these new columns are identical to DateofBirth.
  However, their presence has wide-ranging consequences.

  29.16.4.  A CASE STUDY - PROJECTION

  To find an employee's current salary, things are more difficult.


               SELECT Salary
               FROM Employee
               WHERE Name = 'Bob' AND Start <= CURRENT_DATE AND CURRENT_DATE <= Stop



  This query is more complicated than the previous one. The culprit is
  obviously the two new columns. The OAP wants to distribute to each
  employee their salary history. Specifically, for each person, the max­
  imal intervals at each salary needs to be determined. Unfortunately,
  this is not possible in SQL. An employee could have arbitrarily many
  title changes between salary changes.


       Name    Salary  Title             DateofBirth   Start           Stop
       ----    ------  -----             -----------   -----           ----
       Bob     60000   Assistant Provost 1945-04-09    1993-01-01      1993-05-30
       Bob     70000   Assistant Provost 1945-04-09    1993-06-01      1993-09-30
       Bob     70000   Provost           1945-04-09    1993-10-01      1994-01-31
       Bob     70000   Professor         1945-04-09    1994-02-01      1994-12-31

                                      Figure 1



  Note that there are three rows in which Bob's salary remained constant
  at $70,000. Hence, the result should be two rows for Bob.


       Name    Salary  Start           Stop
       ----    ------  -----           ----
       Bob     60000   1993-01-01      1993-05-30
       Bob     70000   1993-06-01      1994-12-31



  One alternative is to give the user a printout of Salary and Title
  information, and have user determine when his/her salary changed. This
  alternative is not very appealing or realistic. A second alternative
  is to use SQL as much as possible.


       CREATE TABLE Temp(Salary, Start, Stop)
       AS      SELECT Salary, Start, Stop
               FROM Employee;



  repeat


               UPDATE Temp T1
               SET (T1.Stop) = (SELECT MAX(T2.Stop)
                                FROM Temp AS T2
                                WHERE T1.Salary = T2.Salary AND T1.Start < T2.Start
                                       AND T1.Stop >= T2.Start AND T1.Stop < T2.Stop)
               WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                             FROM Temp AS T2
                             WHERE T1.Salary = T2.Salary AND T1.Start < T2.Start
                                       AND T1.Stop >= T2.Start AND T1.Stop < T2.Stop)
               until no rows updated;

       DELETE FROM Temp T1

       WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                     FROM Temp AS T2
                     WHERE T1.Salary = T2.Salary
                               AND ((T1.Start > T2.Start AND T1.Stop <= T2.Stop)
                               OR (T1.Start >= T2.Start AND T1.Stop < T2.Stop))



  The loop finds those intervals that overlap or are adjacent and thus
  should be merged. The loop is executed log N times in the worst case,
  where N is the number of rows in a chain of overlapping or adjacent
  value-equivalent rows. The reader can simulate the query on the exam­
  ple table to convince him/herself of its correctness.

  A third alternative is to use SQL only to open a cursor on the table.
  A linked list of periods is maintained, each with a salary. This
  linked list should be initialized to empty.


       DECLARE emp_cursor CURSOR FOR
               SELECT Salary, Title, Start, Stop
               FROM Employee;
       OPEN emp_cursor;
       loop:
               FETCH emp_cursor INTO :salary, :start, :stop;
               if no-data returned then goto finished;
               find position in linked list to insert this information;
               goto loop;
       finished:
       CLOSE emp_cursor;



  iterate through linked list, printing out dates and salaries

  The linked list may not be necessary in this case if the cursor is
  ORDER BY Start.

  In any case, the query, a natural one, is quite difficult to express
  using the facilities present in SQL-92. The query is trivial in TSQL2.


               SELECT Salary
               FROM Employee



  29.16.5.  A CASE STUDY - JOIN

  A more drastic approach is to avoid the problem of extracting the
  salary history by reorganizing the schema to separate salary, title,
  and date of birth information (in the following, we ignore the date of
  birth, for simplicity).


               Employee1 (Name, Salary, Start DATE, Stop DATE)
               Employee2 (Name, Title, Start DATE, Stop DATE)



  The Employee1 table is as follows.


       Name    Salary  Start           Stop
       ----    ------  -----           ----
       Bob     60000   1993-01-01      1993-05-30
       Bob     70000   1993-06-01      1993-12-31



  Here is the example Employee2 table.


       Name    Title                   Start           Stop
       ----    ------                  -----           ----
       Bob     Assistant Provost       1993-01-01      1993-09-30
       Bob     Provost                 1993-10-01      1994-01-31
       Bob     Professor               1994-02-01      1994-12-31



  With this change, getting the salary information for an employee is
  now easy.


               SELECT Salary, Start, Stop
               FROM Employee1
               WHERE Name = 'Bob'



  But what if the OAP wants a table of salary, title intervals (that is,
  suppose the OAP wishes a table to be computed in the form of Figure
  1)? One alternative is to print out two tables, and let the user fig­
  ure out the combinations. A second alternative is to use SQL entirely.
  Unfortunately, this query must do a case analysis of how each row of
  Employee1 overlaps each row of Employee2; there are four possible
  cases.


       SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee1.Start, Employee1.Stop
       FROM Employee1, Employee2
       WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
            AND Employee2.Start <= Employee1.Start AND Employee1.Stop < Employee2.Stop
       UNION
       SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee1.Start, Employee2.Stop
       FROM Employee1, Employee2
       WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
            AND Employee1.Start >= Employee2.Start AND Employee2.Stop < Employee1.Stop
               AND Employee1.Start < Employee2.Stop
       UNION
       SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee2.Start, Employee1.Stop
       FROM Employee1, Employee2
       WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
            AND Employee2.Start > Employee1.Start AND Employee1.Stop < Employee2.Stop
               AND Employee2.Start < Employee1.Stop
       UNION
       SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee2.Start, Employee2.Stop
       FROM Employee1, Employee2
       WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
            AND Employee2.Start > Employee1.Start AND Employee2.Stop < Employee1.Stop



  Getting all the cases right is a challenging task. In TSQL2, perform­
  ing a temporal join is just what one would expect.


               SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept
               FROM Employee1, Employee2
               WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name



  29.16.6.  A CASE STUDY - AGGREGATES

  Now the OAP is asked, what is the maximum salary? Before adding time,
  this was easy.


               SELECT MAX(Salary)
               FROM Employee



  Now that the salary history is stored, we'd like a history of the max­
  imum salary over time. The problem, of course, is that SQL does not
  provide temporal aggregates. The easy way to do this is to print out
  the information, and scan manually for the maximums. An alternative is
  to be tricky and convert the snapshot aggregate query into a non-
  aggregate query, then convert that into a temporal query. The non-
  aggregate query finds those salaries for which a greater salary does
  not exist.



          SELECT Salary
          FROM Employee AS E1
          WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                            FROM Employee AS E2
                            WHERE E2.Salary > E1.Salary)



  Converting this query into a temporal query is far from obvious. The
  following is one approach.


       CREATE TABLE Temp (Salary, Start, Stop)
       AS      SELECT Salary, Start, Stop
               FROM Employee;
       INSERT INTO Temp
               SELECT T.Salary, T.Start, E.Start
               FROM Temp AS T, Employee AS E
               WHERE E.Start >= T.Start AND E.Start < T.Stop AND E.Salary > T.Salary;

       INSERT INTO Temp
               SELECT T.Salary, T.Stop, E.Stop
               FROM Temp AS T, Employee AS E
               WHERE E.Stop > T.Start AND E.Stop <= T.Stop AND E.Salary > T.Salary;
       DELETE FROM Temp T
       WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                     FROM Employee AS E
                     WHERE ((T.Start => E.Start AND T.Start < E.Stop)
                               OR (E.Start >= T.Start AND E.Start < T.Stop))
                           AND E.Salary > T.Salary;



  This approach creates an auxiliary table. We add to this table the
  lower period of a period subtraction and the upper period of a period
  subtraction.  We then delete all periods that overlap with some row
  defined by the subquery, thereby effecting the NOT EXISTS. Finally we
  generate from the auxiliary table maximal periods, in the same way
  that the salary information was computed above. As one might imagine,
  such SQL code is extremely inefficient to execute, given the complex
  nested queries with inequality predicates.

  A third alternative is to use SQL as little as possible, and instead
  compute the desired maximum history in a host language using cursors.

  The query in TSQL2 is again straightforward and intuitive.


               SELECT MAX(Salary)
               FROM Employee



  29.16.7.  SUMMARY

  Time-varying data is manipulated in most database applications. Valid-
  time support is absent in SQL. Many common temporal queries are either
  difficult to simulate in SQL, or require embedding SQL in a procedural
  language, due to SQL's lack of support for valid-time tables in its
  data model and query constructs.

  Elsewhere, we showed that adding valid-time support requires few
  changes to the DBMS implementation, can dramatically simplify some
  queries and enable others, and can later enable optimizations in
  storage structures, indexing methods, and optimization strategies that
  can yield significant performance improvements.

  With a new part of SQL3 supporting time-varying information, we can
  begin to address such applications, enabling SQL3 to better manage
  temporal data.

  29.17.  Part 8 - ISO/ANSI SQL MULTIMEDIA (SQL/MM)

  A new ISO/IEC international standardization project for development of
  an SQL class library for multimedia applications was approved in early
  1993.  This new standardization activity, named SQL Multimedia
  (SQL/MM), will specify packages of SQL abstract data type (ADT)
  definitions using the facilities for ADT specification and invocation
  provided in the emerging SQL3 specification. SQL/MM intends to
  standardize class libraries for science and engineering, full-text and
  document processing, and methods for the management of multimedia
  objects such as image, sound, animation, music, and video. It will
  likely provide an SQL language binding for multimedia objects defined
  by other JTC1 standardization bodies (e.g. SC18 for documents, SC24
  for images, and SC29 for photographs and motion pictures).

  The Project Plan for SQL/MM indicates that it will be a multi-part
  standard consisting of an evolving number of parts. Part 1 will be a
  Framework that specifies how the other parts are to be constructed.
  Each of the other parts will be devoted to a specific SQL application
  package. The following SQL/MM Part structure exists as of August 1994:


  ·  Part 1: Framework A non-technical description of how the document
     is structured.

  ·  Part 2: Full Text Methods and ADTs for text data processing. About
     45 pages.

  ·  Part 3: Spatial Methods and ADTs for spatial data management. About
     200 pages with active contributions from Spatial Data experts from
     3 national bodies.

  ·  Part 4: General Purpose Methods and ADTs for complex numbers,
     Facilities include trig and exponential functions, vectors, sets,
     etc.  Currently about 90 pages.

  There are a number of standards efforts in the area of Spatial and
  Geographic information:


  ·  ANSI X3L1 - Geographic Information Systems.  Mark Ashworth of
     Unisys is the liason between X3L1 and ANSI X3H2. He is also the
     editor for parts 1, 3, and 4 of the SQL/MM draft.

  30.  Technical support for PostgreSQL

  This is the order of problem solving:

  ·  Your question can be answered by online manuals
     <http://www.postgresql.org/users-lounge>

  ·  Enter a keyword in the search box
     <http://www.postgresql.org/search.cgi>

  ·  Post your question in the mailing list

     If you have any technical question or encounter any problem you can
     e-mail to:

  ·  pgsql-questions@postgresql.org

  ·  Newsgroup  <comp.databases.postgresql.general>


  ·  Newsgroup  <comp.databases.postgresql.hackers>

  ·  Newsgroup  <comp.databases.postgresql.doc>

  ·  Newsgroup  <comp.databases.postgresql.bugs>

  ·  Newsgroup  <linux.postgres>

  ·  Other Mailing lists  <http://www.postgresql.org>

     and expect e-mail answer in less than a day. As the user-base of
     internet product is very vast, and users support other users,
     internet will be capable of giving technical support to billions of
     users easily. Email support is much more convenient than telephone
     support as you can cut and paste error messages, program output
     etc.. and easily transmit to mailing list/newsgroup.


  30.1.  Commercial Support

  PostgreSQL organisation is selling technical support to companies, the
  revenue generated will be used for maintaining several mirror sites
  (web and ftp) around the world. The revenue will also be used to
  produce printed documentation, guides, textbooks which will help the
  customers. They are at <http://www.postgresql.org>

  Another company called 'Great Bridge Corporation' is doing
  development, sales and support of PostgreSQL. They are at
  <http://www.greatbridge.com>. It is a public company setup by
  'Landmark Communications corp' and other venture capital firms to
  exclusively sell and support PostgreSQL to very large enterprises and
  corporations all over the world.

  You can also take help from professional consulting firms like RedHat,
  Anderson, WGS (Work Group Solutions). Contact them for help, since
  they have very good expertise in "C", "C++" (PostgreSQL is written in
  "C") -

  31.  Economic and Business Aspects

  Commercial databases pay many taxes like federal, state, sales,
  employment, social security, medicare taxes, health care for
  employees, bunch of benefits for employees, marketing and
  advertisement costs. All these costs do not go directly for the
  development of the database and do not improve the quality or
  technology of the database. When you buy a commercial database, some
  portion of the amount goes for overheads like taxes, expenses and
  balance for database R&D costs.

  Also commercial databases have to pay for buildings/real-estates and
  purchase Unix machines, install and maintain them. All of these costs
  are passed onto customers.

  PostgreSQL has the advantage over commercial databases as there is no
  direct taxes since it is made on the internet. A very vast group of
  people contribute to the development of the PostgreSQL. For example,
  in a hypothetical case, if there are one million companies in U.S.A
  and each contribute about $ 10 (worth of software to PostgreSQL) then
  each and every company will get ten million dollars!! This is the
  GREAT MAGIC of software development on internet.
  Currently, PostgreSQL source code is about 2,50,000 lines of "C",
  "C++" code. If cost of each line of "C" code is $ 2 then the
  PostgreSQL is worth about $ 5,00,000 (half a million dollars!).

  Many companies already develop in-house vast amount of "C", "C++"
  code. Hence by taking in the source code of PostgreSQL and
  collaborating with other companies on internet will greatly benefit
  the company saving time and efforts.

  33.  Internet World Wide Web Searching Tips

  Internet is very vast and it has vast number of software and has an
  ocean of information underneath. It is growing at the rate of 300%
  annually world wide. It is estimated that there are about 10 million
  Web sites world wide!

  To search for an information you would use search engines like
  "Yahoo", "Netscape", "Lycos" etc. Go to Yahoo, click on search.  Use
  filtering options to narrow down your search criteria. The default
  search action is "Intelligent search" which is more general and lists
  all possiblities. Click on "Options" to select "EXACT phrase" search,
  "AND" search, "OR" search, etc.. This way you would find the
  information you need much faster. Also in the search menu, there are
  radio-buttons for searching in Usenet, Web-sites and Yahoo sites.

  34.  Conclusion

  After researching all the available databases which are free and
  source code is available, it was found that ONLY PostgreSQL is the
  MOST mature, most widely used and robust RDBMS SQL free database
  (object relational) in the world.

  PostgreSQL is very appealing since lot of work had already been done.
  It has ODBC and JDBC drivers, using these it is possible to write
  applications independent of the databases. The applications written in
  PostgreSQL using ODBC, JDBC drivers are easily portable to other
  databases like Oracle, Sybase and Informix and vice versa.

  You may ask "But why PostgreSQL ?" The answer is, since it takes lot
  more time to develop a database system from scratch, it makes sense to
  pick up a database system which satisfies the following conditions -

  A database system

  ·  Whose source code is available - Must be a 'Open Source Code'
     system

  ·  Has no license strings, no ownership strings attached to it

  ·  Which can be distributed on internet

  ·  Which had been on development for several years.

  ·  Which satisfies standards like ISO/ANSI SQL 92 (and SQL 89)

  ·  Which can satisfy future needs like SQL 3 (SQL 98)

  ·  Which has advanced capabilities

     And it just happens to be 'PostgreSQL' which satisfies all these
     conditions and is an appropriate software for this situation.  You
     may say 'PostgreSQL' is a very strange name (It is pronounced as
     Post-gres-cue-el and not Postgre-es-cue-el.  It's a very unusual
     name and it is very hard to pronounce).  But my argument is - why
     change the name. This world is stuck with "PostgreSQL" forever and
     people all over the world love this name!!

  36.  Other Formats of this Document

  This document is published in 11 different formats namely - DVI,
  Postscript, Latex, Adobe Acrobat PDF, LyX, GNU-info, HTML, RTF(Rich
  Text Format), Plain-text, Unix man pages and SGML.

  ·  You can get this HOWTO document as a single file tar ball in HTML,
     DVI, Postscript or SGML formats from -
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/> and
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>

  ·  Plain text format is in:
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO> and
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>

  ·  Single HTML file format is in:
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>

  ·  Translations to other languages like French, German, Spanish,
     Chinese, Japanese are in
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO> and
     <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto> Any help from you to
     translate to other languages is welcome.

     The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can
     be got from - <http://www.sgmltools.org> Compiling the source you
     will get the following commands like

  ·  sgml2html databasehowto.sgml     (to generate html file)

  ·  sgml2rtf  databasehowto.sgml     (to generate RTF file)

  ·  sgml2latex databasehowto.sgml    (to generate latex file)

  LaTeX documents may be converted into PDF files simply by producing a
  Postscript output using sgml2latex ( and dvips) and running the output
  through the Acrobat distill ( <http://www.adobe.com>) command as
  follows:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man sgml2latex
  bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
  bash$ man dvips
  bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
  bash$ distill filename.ps
  bash$ man ghostscript
  bash$ man ps2pdf
  bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
  bash$ acroread output.pdf &
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Or you can use Ghostscript command ps2pdf.  ps2pdf is a work-alike for
  nearly all the functionality of Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
  converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
  ps2pdf is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that
  invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device" called
  pdfwrite. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included
  in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled; see the documentation
  on building Ghostscript for details.

  And resize the window with mouse.  To navigate use Arrow keys, Page
  Up, Page Down keys, also you can use 'f', 'd', 'u', 'c', 'l', 'r',
  'p', 'n' letter keys to move up, down, center, next page, previous
  page etc.  To turn off expert menu press 'x'.

  You can read postscript file using the program 'gv' (ghostview) or The
  ghostscript program is in ghostscript*.rpm package and gv program is
  in gv*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be located through
  ControlPanel | Applications | Graphics menu buttons. The gv program is
  much more user friendly than ghostscript.  Also ghostscript and gv are
  available on other platforms like OS/2, Windows 95 and NT, you view
  this document even on those platforms.

  AO.  Appendix C - Midgard Installation

  RPMs for Midgard from <http://www.midgard-
  project.org/download/binaries> currently do not include PostgreSQL,
  and hence you need to install from the source tar ball file .

  Download the Midgard source tarball and read the INSTALL.REDHAT file -



  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash# cd midgard-lib-1.4beta6
  bash# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-mysql=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/include/mysql --with-midgard=/usr/local --with-pgsql=/var/lib/pgsql --includedir=/usr/include/pgsql
  bash# make
  bash# make install
  bash# ldconfig -v | grep -i midga
  Copy the header files, just in case make install did not do that..
  bash# cp *.h /usr/local/include


  bash# cd ../mod_midgard-1.4beta5c
  bash# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-mysql=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/include/mysql --with-midgard=/usr --with-pgsql=/var/lib/pgsql --includedir=/usr/include/pgsql
  bash# make
  bash# make install
  #modify apache line to correct /usr/.....
  bash# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   (or it is /etc/apache/httpd.conf)
  bash# /etc/init.d/apache restart
  #apache should restart!!!


  bash# cd ../midgard-php-1.4beta6
  bash# ./configure '--with-apxs' '--with-mysql' '--with-pgsql' '--with-midgard' --prefix=/usr/local --with-midgard=/usr/local

  bash# gvim Makefile
  And add -I/usr/include/pgsql to INCLUDE variable.

  Also add $(INCLUDE) to $(APXS) command as below -
  libphp3.so: mod_php3.c libmodphp3-so.a  pcrelib/libpcre.a midgard/libphpmidgard.a
          -@test -f ./mod_php3.c || test -L ./mod_php3.c || $(LN_S) $(srcdir)/mod_php3.c ./mod_php3.c
          -@test -f ./mod_php3.c || test -h ./mod_php3.c || $(LN_S) $(srcdir)/mod_php3.c ./mod_php3.c
          $(APXS) -c -o libphp3.so  -I$(srcdir) $(INCLUDE) -I. -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/lib/glib/include  -Wl,'-rpath /usr/local/lib' ./mod_php3.c libmodphp3-so.a $(APXS_LDFLAGS)

  bash# make
  bash# make install
  #modify apache line to correct /usr/.....
  # and add lines like these -
          LoadModule php4_module        modules/libphp4.so
          AddModule mod_php4.c
          LoadModule php4_module        lib/apache/libphp4.so

          <IfModule mod_php4.c>
                  AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php4
                  AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php
                  AddType application/x-httpd-php4-source .phps
                  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
          </IfModule>

  bash# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   (or it is /etc/apache/httpd.conf)

  bash# /etc/init.d/apache restart
  #apache should restart!!!

  AO.1.  Testing Midgard PHP Server

  To test the installation do this - Create a file in your document root
  directory.  I usually call it info.php and in it put this single line:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  <?phpinfo()?>
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Then load it up in your browser: http://localhost/info.php

  You should see a nice summary page showing all sorts of information
  about your setup.  You probably shouldn't leave this file around on a
  production server, but for debugging and general info during
  development, it is very handy.

  AO.2.  Security OpenSSL

  You may also need to get the RSA package for to enable SSL encryption
  from <ftp://ftp.deva.net/pub/sources/crypto/rsaref20.1996.tar.Z> See
  also OpenSSL RPM package on Linux cdrom ( <http://www.openssl.org>

  If you do not want the SSL to be enabled (or if you face any problem),
  then download the source RPM of Apache-Midgard and edit the *.spec
  file and comment out SSL and rebuild the RPM.
