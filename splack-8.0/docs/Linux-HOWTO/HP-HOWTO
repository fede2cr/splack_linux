  This document describes the use of products available in the [http://
www.hp.com] Hewlett-Packard (HP) catalog with Linux and some free software.
It gives the state of the support for hardware, software to use, answers to
some frequently asked questions and gives elements of sizing. The goals are
to offer a general view of free software functions and their use at best with
HP products; as well as to make new users of HP products rapidly operational
and also to allow others to choose their products knowing facts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2. Presentation of Linux and Free Software 

2.1. Some definitions

  Before going into more details in the presentation, it could be useful to
give some definitions of terms and software mentionned in that HOWTO. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1. Free Software or Open Source software

A free software (or Open Source software) is a software distributed with its
source code, allowing its study, its transmission, its adaptation. The
problem, in english, is the use of free, which has both meanings of "at no
cost" and "without constraint". Here, it's the second use which has to be
considered, hence the use of Open Source. To remember, think of free as
speech, not beer. 

  Depending on the licenses used for its development, the constraints for
users of such a software are various. The most open licenses (like the BSD
one) allow code appropriation by third parties, including the resell of the
resulting software (with or without modification) in commercial products,
without any problem, and without owing something else to the originators than
the mention of their copyright. Other licenses (like the GNU Public License
or GPL) force every modified GPL software to be free GPL software itself ;
this doesn't allow the use of such programs in a commercial one. Many other
licenses exist, more or less open: the Artistic License (perl), the NPL one
(mozilla), the QPL one (Qt) ... 

  A vast majority of free software is today under the GPL license, even if
the BSD world takes always a great place, however less visible, mainly in the
press. Linux is placed under GPL. To have more informations on these
definitions and the licenses, please refer to the following reference sites :

[http://www.gnu.org] GNU project Web site
      You find there all of the informations on the GNU project, including
    the licenses produced (GPL and LGPL) and various discussions on free
    software. 
   
[http://www.opensource.org] Open Source project Web site
      This site proposes a new definition, a bit less restrictive, of free
    software - called here OpenSource Software - by well-known people. 
   

[http://www.freebsd.org/] FreeBSD project Web site
      Here are explained the advantages of the very open BSD license. 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.2. Examples and counter-examples

  First of all, free software and freeware shouldn't be mixed up. A freeware
is not necessarily a software provided with its sources, on the contrary of a
free software. On the other side, on the contrary of a freeware, you may be
charged to obtain a free software (it's not in contradiction with the
licensed used). The ambiguity, as stated before, comes from the word "free" .
A freeware is then free of charge, but not necessarily "free of sources". (As
well, the shareware has nothing to do with free software). 

  So examples of important and well-known free software are the Linux and
FreeBSD operating systems, the [http://www.apache.org] Apache Web server, the
[http://www.samba.org] SaMBa SMB server, GNU C and C++ compilers ... A
contrario, examples of well-known freeware are the Internet Explorer browser,
the Eudora Light mail reader, ... 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3. Linux

Linux is a free operating system, superset of the POSIX norm. "Linux" points
out the kernel alone. By extension, the name is also given to distributions
based on that kernel plus a set of tools from the GNU project. 

  Linux is by consequence a Unix system, except that it doesn't use any
proprietary code and is furnished under the GPL license, implying the
availability of the sources. As every Unix system, Linux is multi-tasking and
multi-user. It's also extremely portable, and it is available officialy today
on processors such as Intel (i386 to Pentium III), Alpha, Motorola (680x0 and
PowerPC), Sparc, StrongArm, Mips. Without mention of the ports, operational
or in process on PalmPilot, Itanium (ex-Merced), PA-Risc, Crusoe ...

  The system is today perfectly stable and mature. Versions "x.y.z" of the
Linux kernel, where "y" is an even number, are stable and only bug
corrections are generaly applied when "z" augments. Versions "x.y.z" of the
Linux kernel, where "y" is an odd number, are development versions which may
be instable and are reserved to developers or intrepids. 

  >From time to time, when the kernel development stabilizes a "freeze" is
announced to furnish a new "stable" version (even), and the development goes
on on a new version (odd). 

  The current stable version is the version 2.4.3 (this last number may
evolve following the rythm of corrections). Development has on the other side
begun again with a 2.4test version currently in code freeze. 

  Numerous presentations of Linux are currently available. Among them, you
should consult the one made by Michael Johnson at [ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/
linux/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html] ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/linux/HOWTO/
INFO-SHEET.html.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3.1. Linux technical characteristics

  The system offers the following technical characteristics : 

  *   Multi-tasking : executes several programs in pseudo-parallel. 
   
  *   Multi-users : many users acting on the same machine at the same time
    (without worrying on licenses). 
   
  *   Portable and interoperable : works on several hardware architectures.
    All the sources are available. Linux supports a lot of file systems,
    outside the native ext2 : System V, BSD, Sun, MS-DOS, VFAT, NTFS, Mac,
    HPFS, EFS, ISO9660. On the network side, it supports the following
    protocols TCP/IP v4 and v6, Appletalk, Netware (client and server), Lan
    Manager SMB (client and server), X-Window, NFS, PPP, SLIP, UUCP.
   
  *   Performant architecture : modular kernel, built at will, execution in
    protect mode on 80x86 processors, page load on demand, page share between
    executables when reading, virtual memory with swap on disk, use of a
    dynamical disk cache in memory, dynamic libraries, process management,
    pseudo terminals, virtual consoles. 
   
  *   Security : protection of memory between processes: one user program
    can't compromise the whole system operation. The kernel may also, on the
    other hand, filter network packets. 
   
  *   Respect of norms and standards : Posix, with System V and BSD
    extensions. Support of COFF and ELF binaries. Binary compatibility with
    SCO, SVR3/4 through the iBCS2 module. Native Language Support as well as
    national keyboards, fonts... 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Free software concepts

  Once the definitions are given, it is important to stay on at ideas
promoted by the free software movement. It's important as well to clear some
wrong ideas hawked on these software. This section gives then a various set
of elements in favour of the introduction of free software and ends on the
real problems remaining to solve. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1. Free software philosophy

  In fact, the philosophy promoted by the free software movement is not that
different from the one proposed by the scientific movement till a long time
already: to put in common ideas and collective knowledge to allow the
progression of the research and the growth of this knowledge. The knowledge
of the human genome is one of the examples of such a collaborative work. 

  The computer engineering environement, and especially the software one,
seems to have turn away till the last 20 years from these base concepts of
the scientific world. It prefers on the contrary to keep the customer captive
instead of giving him the informations needed to exploit his computing
environement the best he can. That's indeed following such a problem at the
begining of the 80's that Richard Stallman, who was doing researches in
artificial intelligence at the MIT, decided to create the GNU project. This
project is the foundation of the current free software movement. 

  The main ideas promoted by this movement and stated by Richard Stallman
himself are : 

  *   Liberty: every user should be free to copy, diffuse, modify a program,
    either to share it with others, or to adapt it to his own needs. As well,
    he should be able to analyse it to understand, imitate, improve, verify
    its operations, as well as every scientific result is published and seen
    by the peers for verification, study, understanding and realisation of
    derived works. Could you imagine a vaccine against the liver cancer that
    another laboratory couldn't derive to make a vaccine against the pancres
    cancer. 
   
  *   Equality: every person should have the same rights on the software.
    Thus the provider isn't priviledged and can't keep customers to whom he
    furnished his work captive. Could you think that only the producer of our
    vaccine could use it ? 
   
  *   Fraternity: this mode of working encourages the whole computer
    engineering community to cooperate and thus to produce software more and
    more reliable and useful to all. Could you imagine that a discovery like
    the vaccine above couldn't help everyone and favour other discoveries. 
   

  More over the utopy of these ideas, we can find other reasons which allowed
free software to spread so widely today. They are detailed in Section 2.2.2.

  The free software movement materializes itself also through a community of
people. That community, informal meeting of personnalities, is heterogeneous
in its contents, actions, ideas, even if all share the same belief in the
freedom of the software. That community created for itself the tools needed
to its communication : Internet and Usenet. And these communication tools are
based of course on a lot of free software to work. Among the outstanding
persons of this movement, we can present : 

  * [http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~torvalds/] Linus Torvalds, conceptor of
    Linux. 
   
  * [http://www.gnu.org/people/rms.html] Richard Stallman, GNU project
    conceptor. 
   
  * [http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr] Eric S. Raymond, writer of several and
    excellent articles, which inspired so many vocations. 
   
  * [http://kiev.wall.org/~larry] Larry Wall, author of Perl and of the patch
    tool, and philosopher. 
   
  * Tim O'Reilly <ask_tim@oreilly.com>, free software advocate and editor of
    several books dedicated to them. 
   

  All these personalities are, above all, excellent computer engineers, which
allows them to be recognized as major actors of the free software movement.
Their human and communication qualities are also strong characteristics of
their nature. In any case they aren't considered for their power, but for
their knowledge. 

  Of course, the free software community is built of thousands of
programmers, whose complete list would be too tedious. All share the will of
producing useful work, free, and to be recognized for their technical
qualities above all. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2. The choice of free software

  To use free software to bring solutions in a computing environment is a
choice. First, it is in favour of a plurality of solutions, mainly in the
personal computer world which tends to be monopolistic. Then, the choice is
made, and that's what is finally important, on the own qualities of free
software, which are detailed just below. 

Source code access
      This point is the most important of the choice, because it allows the
    undestanding, adaptation, correction, distribution, improvement of the
    software. 
   
Reliability
      That quality is derived from the previous one: the free software is the
    combined result of the experience and the intelligence of all the
    participants. Its reliability increases then as time passes, with all the
    corrections which are made. More over, no marketing pression obliges the
    software's producer to deliver it to its customers before it is in a
    satisfactory state. 
   
Portability
      This quality is not intrinsic to free software, but is very often seen
    in a free software. Indeed if a softawre meets success, it will
    necessarily be adapted to other environments than those initialy
    considered. Thus by increasing its disponibility, its portability and
    reliability are also increased. 
   
Universality
      One essential quality of free software is the character naturaly
    universal of the data format used. Even if they don't follow standards,
    the availibility of the source code assures the user that he will
    understand them, and more over be able to write any filter needed to the
    reuse of data or their exchange with other software. This allows also
    users to stabilize their environment, because they are not obliged to
    migrate in case of incompatibility of data formats in their applications.
   
Performance
      Resulting from a lot of examinations, the use of algorithms coming from
    advanced research works, as well as tested by various usages, free
    software have good performances by nature. Frequently large portions of
    code are rewritten to allow the reuse of the original ideas with a better
    code and thus to increase performance. Several tests made by various
    organisms tend to prove it also

      Once more, there is no obligation to diffuse an application whose
    performances would be bad. 
   
Interoperability
      Historically, Unix environment was always a ferment for
    interoperability with other systems (big or medium size systems, as well
    as personal computers). The support in Linux, for example, of a lot of
    network protocols, filesystem formats, and even binary compatibility
    modes assures a good interoperability. 
   
Reactivity
      When considering the more and more longer development cycles of the
    software editors, the reactivity brought by the free software movement is
    interesting for a lot of sites, concerned by the rapid obtention of
    corrections to a given problem. Thus, during the recent discoveries of IP
    problems (ping of the death,...), patches were always available within
    the next 3 days. And above that, only the patch correcting the hole found
    was delivered. There were no functionality added, which could have create
    other instabilities. 
   

  Independantly of its qualities, it's possible to give other reasons of
various nature, in favor of free software, depending on the type of the
person met. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.1. Marketing argumentation

  Studies from IDC bring to light the irresistible rise of Linux as a server
operating system. In 1998, Linux is credited with 17% of market share, with
an increase of 212%, which is the most important in that domain. The
following graphics give the whole market share repartition. 

Figure 2-1. Server operating system repartition in 1998 (IDC). 

[idc1998]

  This was confirmed in 1999 with a market share climbing to 24% and an
ancrease of 93%, always more than four times the increase of the follower.


Figure 2-2. Server operating system repartition in 1999 (IDC). 

[idc1999]

  Dataquest [http://gartner6.gartnerweb.com/dq/static/about/press/
pr-b9939.html] estimates on its side that Linux servers will represent, with
1.1 million of units, 14% of the servers sold in 2003. 

  the Net itself produces marketing tools to demonstrate the superiority of
free software. Two counters are regularly updated by [http://www.netcraft.com
/survey/] Netcraft, on web server software, and by [http://www.leb.net/hzo/
ioscount/index.html] IOS Counter for the servers on Internet. Results,
reproduced below, show the importance taken by [http://www.apache.org] Apache
with more than 6 millions of operational sites, crushing the competition, as
well as the free operating systems Linux and *BSD which dominate the world of
Internet servers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.2. Financial argumentation

  Financial arguments also speaks for free software. And first the price to
aquire them is low. Low, because it's never zero. Even if you can find it on
Internet, you have to consider the costs related to that link. However costs
are greatly less expensive than for commercial software. So a RedHat 7.0
Linux distribution, delivered with more than 1200 software packages, costs
about 60 USD when you have to pay more than 800 USD to obtain Windows NT
server, delivered only with IIS. 

  On the other side, free software don't have the notion of license by user
or by supplmentary service. Thus there is no additional cost when you have to
increase the use of these software in your entity. That's of course not the
case with commercial software whose economical logic is often based on the
number of licenses. 

  Free software bring in addition a better mastering of the TCO (Total Cost
of Ownership), mentionned so frequently in the massive deployment of personal
computers. Thus administration costs are reduced because systems like Linux
or FreeBSD, as Unix, are managed completely remotely, either through command
line orders (with telnet) or in graphical mode by using X-Window. More over,
we benefit from a true multi-users mode, improving these management
operations. Always in this domain, it's also possible to do remote
management, either through the own hardware capacities (as the Remote
Assistant card integrated in most HP NetServers), or by doing a remote
connexion (through modem, ISDN adapter or a permanent link) thanks to the
native protocol PPP and secure connexion systems as tunneling or ssh. This
managemnt could even be realised by an external entity, in outsourcing. 

  At last, the costs due to the hardware themselves could be controled; on
one side, if by chance free software don't meet the needs, it's always
possible to buy then commercial software solutions to cover the rest. On the
other side, solutions based on free software have good performances by
nature, and can use hardware platforms which would be considered as obsolete,
if installed following the standard criterias of other operating systems or
applications. It's so possible to use "old" hardware, mainly to model. It's
then possible to invest, with a fine knowledge, when puting the solution in
operation, if needed. The power increase may naturaly take place
progressively. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.3. Technical argumentation

  This argumentation was already given in the previous sections. I think
nevertheless that some notions may be explained with complementary
informations. 

  So concerning the reliability aspects of free software based solutions,
it's important to note that it implies an operational running time very high
(standard characteristic of Unix systems in general). This is mesured by the
command uptime. One of Medasys and HP customers, Saint-Michel Hospital, has a
Vectra VL5 acting as router under Linux since more than 300 days. And that's
not a isolated case. 

  Respect of standards and norms, as well as the extreme portability of free
software assures also to applications developed on these platforms the same
qualities. And notably, if after their use, the performances or services
brought by free software based architectures were insufficient, it would be
easy to migrate to machines offering more performances and capacities of
evolution, as the HP 9000 systems, running HP-UX. 

  At last a development plan centered around performances implies a
modularity, such as it's possible to resize the system kernel nearest to the
capacities of the hardware or to use dynamically loaded modules following the
needs. A packages installation may vary from 40 GB for a minimal system up to
many GB for a complete distribution. The system linearity allow also the
support of multi-processors machines (SMP) (tested up to 32 processors on a
Sparc machine). The system modularity allows also to obtain an operational
system on a 1.44 MB floppy disk, either to realize a minimal repair
environment, or to provide a perfectly operational router. The world of
embedded systems shows besides more and more interest for systems such as
Linux, because above it's modularity, source availability makes communication
with dedicated peripherals easier (acquisition cards, sonde, ...). Entities
as CERN or Thomson already use such solutions. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.4. Solutions argumentation

  That argumentation is probably the most important of all, because it's
useless to have free software if it's not to make something useful with it or
to offer solutions to demands of entities willing to use it. In which sectors
free softawre may bring solutions today ? Well, you have to admit it's in
nearly all the sectors of enterprise computing. 

  Historically, Open Source Software were used to realise Internet/Intranet
servers, because their growth was following the one of the Net. It's so
possible to cover all aspects linked to the Internet, from the Web server (
[http://www.apache.org] Apache ), FTP server ([http://www.landfield.com/
wu-ftpd] Wu-Ftpd), DNS server ([http://www.isc.org/bind.html] Bind), the
E-Mail server ([http://www.sendmail.org] Sendmail or [http://www.postfix.org]
PostFix ), the Usenet groups server([http://www.isc.org/inn.html] INN), the
proxy server ([http://juanjox.linuxhq.com/] IPmasqadm), the firewall ([http:/
/www.rustcorp.com/linux/ipchains/] IP-Chains), Virtual Private Network
([http://www.openssh.com/] OpenSSH), the Cache server for the Web ( [http://
squid.nlanr.net/Squid/] Squid ) or also the Time server ([http://
www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp] NTP) or as([http://www.openldap.org] LDAP) server,
or as content management([http://www.midgard.org] Midgard") server ... All
these software are available in standard in a Linux distribution. The client
computer should be equiped with the software corresponding to the application
used (mail reader, news reader, web browser, ...) whatever its operating
system. The choice of the client is free, as all these tools respect the
standards decreed in the [ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/rfc] RFCs.

  The second preferential domain for free software is the file and print
server domain. For these services, clients may be multiple: Unix type (use of
[ftp://ftp.mathematik.th-darmstadt.de/pub/linux/okir] NFS and [ftp://
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc/] KNFS or also [http://
www.coda.cs.cmu.edu] Coda, for file sharing and of lpd for print service),
Microsoft Windows type (use of [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa , which allows
also the use of local client printers), Novell type (Use of [http://
www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe] Mars_nwe) or MacIntosh type (use of [http://
www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk] NetAtalk). All these software are provided in
standard in a Linux distribution and don't need any modification at the
client level to work. 

  The other domains where a system such as Linux may bring solutions is the
computation one, with support of [http://www.irisa.fr/prive/mentre/smp-faq/]
multiprocessor, linked to the realisation of [http://hp-linux.cern.ch/]
clusters with multiple nodes with high-speed network interfaces (100 Mbit/s,
[http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/index.html#gigabit] Gigabit or
[http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/myri.html] Myrinet); those of data security with
the support of HP NetRaidRem. cards, allowing Raid level of 0, 1, 3, 5, 10,
50, and HotSpare disks, managed by the harware; those of centralized fax
server, with a free software like [http://www.hylafax.org] HylaFAX or also as
an archive/backup server with HP SureStore DAT or DLT libraries thanks to a
commercial software like [http://www.arkeia.com] Arkeia or at last as a
database server with free solutions like [http://www.postgreSQL.org/]
PostgreSQL,[http://www.mysql.org/] MySQL or commercial like [http://
platforms.oracle.com/linux/index_lin.htm] Oracle, to speak only of these
three. 

  On the client side, even if it's less highlighted for the moment,
possibilities to use solutions based on free or commercial software are
numerous. There also the Internet part is the main one, with tools like
graphical web browsers ([ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/] Netscape)
or textual ([http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html] lynx), a lot
of graphical mail readers ([http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/6702/

...) or textual ([http://www.mutt.org/] mutt, [ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/

for a personal computer today as a PDF reader ([http://www.adobe.com/

environments ([http://www.gnome.org] Gnome, [http://www.kde.org] KDE, [http:/
/www.opengroup.org/desktop/] Motif, ...). The evolution of these last tools
indicates that the 2000's may be the years where Linux and free software will
break through at their turn on the client. 

  I want to mention that this document was realized on an HP Brio BAx equiped
only with a Linux distribution, with the help of tools like [http://
www.sgmltools.org/] SGMLTools, [http://www.jclark.com/jade] Jade and [http://
www.oasis-open.org/docbook/] DocBook, which allowed to generate from a single
source the formats HTML, Txt, RTF, PostScript, and PDF.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.5. Service argumentation

  This one was for a long time a blocking point to the expansion of free
software in the firms. It's not the case today. Many service providers or
hardware manufacturers, like HP, control today these solutions and propose
support around them. 

  Other sources of informations are also available, in abundance, through
several web sites dedicated to these solutions, specialised mailing-lists,
and various Usenet groups, such as for Linux, the international groups under 
comp.os.linux.* or for the french speaking people under fr.comp.os.linux.*.

  Concerning competences, more and more young engineers or academics finish
their learning cycle being trained to the use of free applications and
operating systems. This wealth of competences arrives now on the labour
market and will contribute to increase the movement of generalisation of
these tools. At last, many firms have internaly ignored competences. In fact,
their employees often install this software at home, and have a good
mastering, usable when arrives the deployment of the software in their
professional structure. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.3. Wrong ideas on free software

  Advocating free software consists also to mention some generally accepted
ideas concerning them and to fight them. 

"There is no support, no training"
      As seen previously, support is currently structuring itself. A firm
    like [http://www.redhat.com] RedHat provides today support for their
    solutions. Only in France, we may mention firms like [http://
    www.medasys.fr] Medasys , [http://www.atrid.fr] Atrid, [http://
    www.alcove.fr] Alcove which assure support on free software. Likewise,
    always in France, training on free software may be given by [http://
    www.france.hp.com/formation] HP France, [http://www.learningtree.com/fr/
    index.htm] Learning Tree, the [http://form-continue.iut-velizy.uvsq.fr/]
    IUT de Vélizy, without mentioning generic network and Unix trainings
    (besides proposed also by the same organizations) which represent a
    fundamental base in a training course. And at last, we should mention the
    ability of each of us to self-train, mainly thanks to the huge
    documentation available (See the Chapter 6).
   
"There is no documentation"
      There is a whole set of manuals, the [http://www.linuxdoc.org] Linux
    Documentation Project made of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and HOWTO,
    counting more than 300 documents around Linux, the main being [http://
    www.traduc.org] translated in french, available as free documentation.
    This documentation has a various quality, more or less up to date,
    following the subjects, certainly but it makes a corpus allowing to
    apprehend alone a Linux distribution and all its components. For myself,
    I always found in it everything I needed to do my job with free software.
    And, in case of complementary informations, a lot of web sites and Usenet
    groups may again bring some of the elements needed. And without counting
    the innumerable manual pages available on line. 
   
      On the other side, the editors [http://www.editions-oreilly.fr]
    O'Reilly and [http://www.ssc.com] SSC have specialised in providing books
    around free software, written generaly by the writers of the software
    themselves. Their books are considered as reference books in their
    respective domains. 
   
"A free or nearly free product is a toy"
      You should always make a difference between free (as speech) and free
    (as beer). Too many freeware in Microsoft environment are in fact toys
    and of poor quality. It's absolutely not the case for free software, as
    stated in the previous sections. Remember just that they are reliable by
    construction. 
   
"Linux is difficult to install"
      Linux is a professional operating system. At that title, it requires
    competences to install it, as well as any other professional operating
    system, like the other Unix or Windows NT for example. But it isn't more
    difficult to install than those either, mainly thanks to distributions as
    RedHat 7.0, Mandrake 7.2, ... You need about 30 minutes to realize a
    complete installation of such distributions, so quite the same as for
    HP-UX and noticeably less than for Windows NT Server. 
   
      On the other hand, as before installing a server with Windows NT you
    have to verify its compatibilité with the [http://www.microsoft.com/HCL]
    Hardware Compatibility List of Microsoft, for Linux it's also greatly
    recommended to verify the [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/mirror/
    linux/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html] Hardware HOWTO, and for HP machines
    to refer to this [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-Howto/HP-HOWTO-EN/
    hp-hardware.html] page.
   
"Free Software are not adequate for heavy tasks"
      This is less and less true and this criticism will be obsolete with the
    next versions of the Linux kernel which will include a journalised
    filesystem, allowing a true application cluster. But already Linux
    authorises the use of multi-processors, several nodes to realise
    computation clusters. And don't forget it's used by the portal [http://
    www.voila.fr] Voila (France Telecom) or the engine [http://www.deja.com]
    Deja among other prestigious references. As well, FreeBSD is used with
    success as the world biggest ftp server : [ftp://ftp.cdrom.com] Walnut
    Creek CDROM server
   
"What appeal do I have in case of problem with the editors ?"
      There is no appeal, because software licences deny all responsabilities
    for the writers, in case of problem. But, in reality developers are
    always ready to help in case of problem and try to correct as soon as
    possible the bugs encountered (for the F00F bug of the pentium, a patch
    for the Linux kernel was published within 3 days, for example). On the
    other side, commercial editors guarantee very badly users against
    problems other than packaging errors. please read the notes furnished
    with your software to judge. 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.4. Real problems around free software

  It would not be honest to negate certain remaining problems linked to free
software. Some have begun to disappear, other are inherent to the system,
other at last will take time to diappear. 

  The first problem, inherent to the model of free software, is the
multiplicity of tools and distributions available. So, if you want to setup a
mail server, you have to choose between Sendmail, Exim, PostFix, Qmail,
Smail. As well if you want to install Linux, you may choose between the
distributions [http://www.redhat.com] RedHat , [http://www.suse.de] SuSE,
[http://www.slackware.com] Slackware, [http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en]
Mandrake, [http://www.turbolinux.com] Turbo Linux, [http://www.debian.org]
Debian. This represents often a problem for the newcomer, but the esperienced
user will always prefer to have a large choice he will confront to his
particularities and to his experience. As long as an actor respects the rules
by freeing his code (it's the case of the rpm and deb formats for example),
there is little risk from the comunity point of view. 

  The second problem, inherent also to the free software birth, is the
necessity to have strong Unix and Internet competences, to manage such
solutions. The power available through these systems is proportional to the
competence of their administrators. And that will stay true even with the
growth of more and more grahical solutions to manage them. On the other side,
you capitalize the investment in time to learn their functions and that
doesn't disappear, because you don't have to re-learn eveything from one
version to the other. Don't forget that systems you use daily seem to be
simple, uniquely because you passed enough time to learn them. For Internet
competences, it's a statement of the obvious to say that this investment
isn't lost. At last, even with the work of translators to provide
informations in french and other languages, a good knowledge in technical
english is definitively a plus. 

  The last problem met in the implementation of free software solutions is to
suceed in convincing some mnagers to go against the prevailing opinion. The
aim of this part is precisely to give all sorts of argumentations to achieve
that goal, but you need each time to show conviction to get his way in the
end. As soon as these solutions will be adopted by big firms principaly,
resistances will disappear. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. Linux and other operating systems

  The aim is not to examine completely or to compare the functions of the
various operating systems available. It's more upon looking at the respective
positions of Linux in comparaison with other systems. Only systems having a
sufficient representation on the market are considered. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.1. Linux and other proprietary Unix (HP-UX, Tru64, AIX, Solaris, Irix)

  The situation taken by all the hardware manufacturers place Linux today in
the entry level (when it's taken in account) and their own Unix system in the
middle and high level. Reality is sometimes more cruel than the situation
wanted by the marketing department :-). Technically, a Linux distribution has
no cause to be envious of the manufacturers Unix solutions, except for the
moment the set of commercial applications. And we can often see that users
dope their workstations with free software to complete their usage. 

  To be precise in the talk, we should consider manufacturers Unix solutions
as split in stations and servers. 

  On the station side, there's no doubt in my mind: for a customer, the only
reason today to buy one is linked to the availability of a software or a
hardware which wouldn't exist in the free environment, or due to intrinsic
performances of the machine. In the first case, we can see that this argument
should have a short life time, because logically every software editor
(except maybe hardware manufacturers) and every hardware manufacturer has
interest in porting their applications or allowing the use of their hardware
on all the major environments in the market. As shown by Oracle, Informix,
Sybase, ... Linux becomes today one of the major environments. In the second
case, the difference in term of performances between the Linux dominant
platform (IA-32) and the other competitors decreases and should even
disappear with the availability of the IA-64 architecture, which seems to be
adopted largely by a majority of actors. More over, Linux is often available
natively on the processors of these actors (Sparc, Mips, PowerPC, 68xxx,
Alpha, Crusoe, PA-Risc to come). I think Linux may represent the famous
unique and standard Unix that everybody dreamed of from a long time, without
succeeding to impose it (the open and free characteristics brought by Linux
are not without influence on that). I think that at the end hardware
manufacturer Unix workstations will be restricted to some niches such as high
end computation, virtual reality, ... and that as long as solutions are not
available on a free environment. Linux offers all the functional qualities of
the other Unix systems, and thus of the workstation, on a more various
hardware platform and potentially at a better price, if on PCs. So it is the
natural choice of every computer engineer with a strong Unix culture (old
customer of the workstation) who will prefer that solution to the migration
to a Microsoft system typically. 

  On the server side, in addtion to the points mentionned previously for the
stations, problems are more complex. Ram, disks, processors capacities,
extensions of every kind make them difficultly repleacable by machines with a
IA-32 architecture for example. More over, certain solutions such as high
availability clusters for example are not already in production in a Linux
environment. The other brake is often linked to investments already done
around software solutions deployed on these servers. Whatever their natural
life time is much higher than those of the stations. Changes will thus be
made more slowly in that domain. Here we can consider rightly Linux solutions
as an entry/middle level solutions, when hardware manufacturer Unix servers
are the middle/high level. The introduction of Linux in place of these
machines will begin only with a massive availability of applications, mainly
in the management sector. 

  The advantages of the hardware manufacturer solutions, explaining why they
are so often chosen when applications are critical, are linked to the
homogeneity of the solution (hardware and software mastered by the same
entity, which can't invoke a third party in case of problem), and to the
support and maintenance garantees furnished. 

  Finally, there is not so much antagonism between these systems, because
they are full cousins. Their association allows today to computer teams
"pro-Unix" to have solutions from start to finish, without having to lose in
functions, as it's so often the case with other operating systems available
for personal computers. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.2. Linux and SCO

  The comparaison between Linux and the SCO systems seems to me quite
unbalanced. First, all the previous points are vaild here also. More over,
SCO isn't a hardware manufacturer, so the homogeneity advantage disappears.
the IA-32 Intel platform is supported by both systems, so cost is identical.
On the other hand, the software solution has a disproportionate cost (few
software provided in the base install, thus a lot of expenses to extend, as
well as to increase the number of users). Having to manage one OpenServer, I
can say that performances are far beyond those of a Linux system. More over,
its conception is older, abounds of symbolic links which makes management
complex. The hardware supported by SCO is less numerous than those Linux
supports. Only stay as an advantage the installed base and the set of
applications available. But for how long ? Besides the fact that SCO choose
Monterey (AIX based) for the IA-64 port seems significant for the future
reserved to OpenServer or UnixWare. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.3. Linux and Windows NT

  The comparaison is here more difficult, because Windows NT isn't an open
system, as the precedings, which is already redhibitory for certain users. An
excellent [http://unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/] comparaison was made by John Kirch
between Unix and Windows NT Server. I recommend to people searching to have
an enlightened opinion on this subject to read it; it's updated regularly and
was written by a specialist of both Microsoft and Unix operating systems.
Financially, obvious advantage for the free software. And it's more obvious,
as for SCO, if you consider the set of complementary software you need to use
a server. The author evaluates the difference from 1 to 100 all the same !
Technically, either on the functions provided or on the reliability, the
administration, the performances, the hardware supported, and more over the
security, Unix systems and particularly free systems outperform what is
proposed by Windows NT. The fact to have a GUI non independant from the
kernel contributes greatly to the instability of NT, because it's more
difficult to avoid errors in a GUI (there is no mastering possible of the
user comportment in front of it) rather than in a kernel. 

  Which are the real advantages of Windows NT ?: the marketing power of
Microsoft which persuades the world that computers equal Windows and which
leans on the enormous installed base; its office applications (a monopolistic
situation on the market) only available in this environment; the confusion
maintained between the various flavours of Windows (95/98, NT, 2000), and
between the server and client functions; its agreements with the biggest
hardware manufacturers which often oblige them to provide a Microsoft system
with their platforms; its technological initiatives to occupy the market in
first, based on proprietary code and that often without respect of known or
documented standards. 

  The lack of hegemony in the servers sector is the best reason to hope that
a plurality of solutions may exist in the future for computers users, also at
the desktop.

Chapter 3. Linux and HP products

 To maintain such a chapter is an endless task :-).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Informations on HP products and Linux

3.1.1. General informations

  HP became recently concious of the importance taken by Linux and free
software in general, and on its machines particularly. Thus a web site
dedicated to Linux in HP environment is now available at [http://www.hp.com/
go/linux] http://www.hp.com/go/linux.

  In France, there is for a longer time a site on these themes, under the
responsability of Jacques Misselis <Jacques_Misselis@hp.com>, hosted by
[http://www.ec-lyon.fr] l'École Centrale de Lyon at the address [http://
hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/hpeduc/education] http://hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/hpeduc/education.

  On the other side, the firm [http://www.medasys.fr] Medasys , for which I
worked between 1996 and 2000, put at disposition of the community a certain
number of informations since 1997, available at [http://www.medasys.fr/linux]
http://www.medasys.fr/linux. This HOWTO is the result of this work. 

  HP also realized a synthesis document (PDF format) concerning his position
in front of Linux, the [../mirror/white-paper.pdf] White Paper HP Linux
Strategy.

  HP is a member of [http://www.li.org] Linux International.

September 1999 issue, and an article on Linux RedHat solutions on HP
Visualize workstation in the November 1999 issue.

3.2. HP hardware supported by Linux

  This section presents HP hardware supported today by Linux. Informations
are based on the latest stable version of the Linux kernel, which is
currently version 2.4.3. A development kernel (version 2.4test) is also
available but doesn't offer any garantee of stability. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Intel based computer range

  Page last updated the 6th of April 2001.

  That computer range is today the main set of HP machines supported by
Linux, and that till many years. In case you didn't already do it before,
some preliminaty readings are recommended before to try to install Linux on
these platforms.

  The [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/mirror/linux/LDP/HOWTO/
Installation-HOWTO.html] Linux Installation HOWTO contains a great number of
informations to install Linux. If you bought linux on a CD-ROM, chances are
that installation instructions are provided with it (the little booklet
inside the disk case, and/or files on the CD). 

  The [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/mirror/linux/LDP/HOWTO/
Kernel-HOWTO.html] Linux Kernel HOWTO should be read to have details on
kernel construction. I will just mention here points which are specific to HP
hardware. 

  Outside particular indication, Linux support means during the installation
of a RedHat 7.0 distribution. In special cases, a kernel rebuild will be
necessary to support completely some hardware elements. You should note that
what is true for one distribution is generally true for another, as these
functions are linked to the kernel or the XFree86 server, and not to the
distribution itself. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1.1. The desktop range (Brio, Vectra, Kayak)

  HP has a new program called "Freedom of Choice" on the whole desktop range.
Linux is thus one of hte operating systems pushed by HP. Cf: [http://
www.hp.com/desktops/linux/] http://www.hp.com/desktops/linux/ and [http://
www.hp.com/pressrel/aug00/14aug00.htm] http://www.hp.com/pressrel/aug00/
14aug00.htm.

A [http://www.hp.com/desktops/linux/linuxfaq.html] FAQ is also available. 

  HP insures the support of certified Linux hardware by the following method
: all the machines have the [http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/
indexes/Driver39.html] Diagtool utility. If this utility indicates a problem,
it's taken in account by HP maintenance. If it doesn't, it's considered as a
software problem and should be reported to the distribution provider.  

  The following tables indicate the state of Linux support by these platforms
:

The health monitoring system HP Kayak Maxilife, available on the whole Kayak
range, is supported by Linux with the tool [http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78]
Lm_sensors

  Visualize systems come in two flavors: the p and x class systems are
preinstalled, supported, and configured with Windows; the pl and xl class
systems are preinstalled, supported, and configured with Linux. There is no
hardware difference between the base systems, but the Linux image that is
preinstalled on the pl and xl is customized so that all drivers for the
systems are preconfigured -- there's no need to specify or tune the box and
drivers.

G100 card
      To use the MGA G100 AGP card, with a version of XFree86 before the
    3.3.2 one, you have to use an option in the file XF86Config : Option
    "no_accel".
   
      Section example :
    Section "Device"                                                 
    [...]

ATI Rage Mobility video card
      The maximum resolution supported by vthis chipset in frame-buffer mode
    is 800x600 in 16 bpp (vga=0x315 in /etc/lilo.conf)
   
      This chipset is also supported by XFree 3.3.6 with the Mach64 driver
    and a patch available at [http://www.staikos.on.ca/~staikos/tp1460/
    XFMa64-Rage-Thinkpad.patch] http://www.staikos.on.ca/~staikos/tp1460/

GD 5465 video card
      To use a Cirrus Logic GD 5465 AGP card, with a version below Xfree86
    3.3.3, you have to use an option in the file XF86Config : Option
    "xaa_no_color_exp".
   
      Section example :
    Section "Device"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
           Identifier "CL-GD5465"                                    
           VendorName "Cirrus"                                       
           BoardName  "GD5465"                                       
           VideoRam   2048                                           
           Option     "xaa_no_color_exp"                             
    EndSection                                                       
   
      Some users who had problems with the support of this chipset were more
    satisfied with the use of the "sw_cursor" option. 
   
Elsa Gloria Synergy card
      Specifications of that card should be consulted on Elsa web site. This
    card is equiped with an hardware OpenGL accelerator. Under Linux, there
    is an OpenGL compatible layer called Mesa. This layer begins to support
    hardware accelerators, and among them the 3DLabs chipset which is on Elsa
    Gloria cards.

Silicon Motion LynxE card
      This card is only supported from the 3.3.6 version of XFree86.
    Nevertheless, even in that version, this is a preliminary support, which
    isn't as stable as the Frame Buffer mode. 
   
      On the other hand, to be able to install a RedHat 6.1 version, you
    should do that in text mode, because the server provided (3.3.5) doesn't
    support this card. 
   
      If you have a dual-boot system, booting first on Windows, and
    initialize the card through its driver seems to improve the oprations
    then under Linux (warm reboot). 
   
      Versions of XFree86 above 4.0.2 also offer the support of this chipset.
   
Intel i810/i815 card
    (Informations provided by Frédéric Dubuy <F.Dubuy@atrid.fr>, Anne-Marie
    Mahfouf <a-m.mahfouf@lineone.net> and Jean-Bernard Chaffardon <
    Jean-Bernard_Chaffardon@hp.com>)
   
      These cards are only supported with a specific X server XFCom_i810/5
    downloadable in both format [ftp://download.intel.com/support/graphics/
    intel815/xfcom_i810-1.2-3.i386.rpm] RPM or [ftp://download.intel.com/

      To summarize, once the X server installed, the module compiled and
    installed, it's sufficient to modify with the following parameters the
    file /etc/X11/XF86Config :
    Section "Device"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
          Identifier "i810"                                          
    [...]                                                            
    EndSection                                                       
                                                                     
    [...]                                                            
    Section "Screen"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
          Driver "svga"                                              
          Device "i810"                                              
    [...]                                                            
    EndSection                                                       
   
      You have to note that the agpgart module provided by Intel should
    replace the one delivered in the kernel so that it works. You then have
    to reinstall it, particularly when a kernel update occurs. 
   
S3 Savage 4 card
      This card is only supported with a specific X server downloadable at

D6692A card
      To use the D6692A card, you need to use a 2.1.122 kernel at least.
    Previous kernels didn't handled correctly the shared IRQ between the
    network and SCSI parts of the card. In particular, a standard RedHat 5.2
    version doesn't allow to the network part to be supported. You have to
    update your kernel with a recent one (preferably 2.4.3) and the
    distribution with the complementary packages needed.

Alsa Sound Drivers
      The Alsa project has for primary goals to develop drivers to support
    sound cards in Linux, being fully compatible with current OSS drivers,
    bringing more functionalities and supporting more hardware. 
   
      All the information on this project, as well as sources under the GPL
    license, are available from their home page [http://www.alsa-project.org]

      RPMs for RedHat 6.2 and Turbo Linux 6.0 distribution are available at
    the address [http://hp-linux.org/aau/alsa] http://hp-linux.org/aau/alsa
   
DOS models
      These models are delivered with MS-DOS only, in order to have a Linux
    Machine at the best price. 
   
Turbo Linux models
      These models are delivered ready to be installed with Turbo Linux, in
    order to have a Linux Machine at the best price (2 CDs + 30 days of
    support). 
   
XU800
      On that machine, the Bios doesn't give the right amount of memory which
    is in the machine to Linux. You need to use a line such as append="mem=
    xxxM" at the begining of /etc/lilo.conf where xxx is your RAM in MB. 
   
      The support of "big size" IDE disks (for example, 27 GB disks provided
    for the XU 800) on these machines needs a kernel 2.2.15 at least. 
   
Omnibook XE
      If you intend to use both the sound chipset and a PCMCIA card in this
    laptop, in order to avoid conflicts at input/output ports level, you'll
    have to modify the file /etc/pcmcia/config.opts to change the line 6 to
    include port 0x300-0x4ff, port 0x1000-0x17ff                     
    The NSC PC87108/338 chipset controlling IrDA on this model is supported
    by the 0.93 kernel. (Source : [http://www.bits.bris.ac.uk/madmatt/
    laptop.shtml] http://www.bits.bris.ac.uk/madmatt/laptop.shtml)
   
      Some users had to apply the same tric for their Omnibook 4150 with
    success. 
   
Omnibook XE3
      It is recommended to not launch /sbin/halt under X11. The integrated
    modem card is not supported under Linux (ESS ES56CVM-PL).
   
      The installation of a RedHat 6.2 distribution gives a problem when
    rebooting the system, at the PCMCIA initialisation. You have to install
    the latest version of the pcmcia-cs package at [ftp://
    pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/pub/pcmcia-cs/] ftp://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net
    /pub/pcmcia-cs/
   
      To use the network, you need a tulip driver modified by P.
    "goldpenguin" Depouilly, and available at [http://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/
    ~depouill/XE3/tulip.tar.gz] http://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~depouill/XE3/
    tulip.tar.gz
   
RedHat models
      These models are delivered preloaded with a improved distribution based
    on RedHat (shameless plug, as I did it :-) 
   
LC 2000
      In order to use the native SCSI controler you need to disable in the
    Bios the option "Reserve PCI Bus Numbers", in the menu PCI Device
    Setting. (Indication of GILLYNN COUCH) 
   
LP1000r/LP2000r
      To use the native SCSI bus of this machine, it's necessary to use the
    sym53c8xx driver with a version upon 1.6c. A driver disk for RedHat
    distributions is available for versions [../mirror/ddsymrh62.img] 6.2 and
    [../mirror/ddsymrh70.img] 7.0.
   
      For the SuSE 7.0 distribution, you have to enter the manual mode to
    load the driver, as autodetection doesn't work correctly. 
   
LH 6000
      In order to use the native SCSI controler you need to desactivate in
    the Bios the "reserver PCI Bus #s", in the menu PCI Device Setting. The
    PS/2 system doesn't work correctly with a RedHat 6.1 or 6.2 distribution.
    In order to correct that you need to either put the machine in MPS 1.1,
    in the BIOS, or use a kernel above 2.3.47 in MPS 1.4 mode. The network
    card doesn't work correctly with the kernel of the RedHat 6.2
    distribution. 
   
LT 6000r
      In order to use the native SCSI controler you need to desactivate in
    the Bios the "reserver PCI Bus #s", in the menu PCI Device Setting. 
   
BX Chipset
      Intel BX Chipset (Memory Bus at 100 MHz) is supported by [ftp://
    ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel] kernels above 2.0.34/2.1.103.
   
i820 Chipset
      Coppermine 0.18 µm technology - 256 kB synchronous cache - Intel i820
    Chipset 
   
P4 - i850 Chipset
      These machines are equiped with a Pentium IV processor, supported by
    kernels 2.2.18/2.4.0 and above. The RedHat 7.0 and TurboLinux 6.1
    distributions, e.g., can be installed correctly on this kind of machines.
   
BAx
      Attention, the XF86_SVGA server works correctly with this mother board
    embedded version only above XFree86 3.3.5, due to the use of different
    frequencies (In particular, use the updates for RedHat 5.2/6.0).
   
Boot disk for 3Com card
    Creation of a custom RedHat 5.1 Boot disk
   
      To be able to boot with the RedHat 5.1 boot disk, and to have the
    support of the 3C905B-TX card, you need to do the following : 
   
    # Log as root. Go in the home directory  (~root)

Boot/Driver disk for RedHat distribution
      To be able to boot with a RedHat distribution (>6.1), and to have the
    recognition of a peripheral non supported in standard in the
    distribution, you need to do the following : 
   
      Download the delopment toolkit to create driver disk for the RedHat
    distribution at the following address: [http://people.redhat.com/
    dledford] http://people.redhat.com/dledford
   
      Install the sources of the driver in a directory and follow the
    instructions of the README file of the kit to create the modules
    necessary for the various kernel of the distributions.

LH 4
      The LH4 doesn't seem to work correctly when not in Raid. Even with the
    latest Bios available at the time of the test (16.00), the problem
    remains. If you desactivate the Raid management, during the boot, the
    ncr53c8xx driver in Linux detects 4 controlers instead of 2 and boot
    doesn't end. To avoid that, you have to activate the Raid in the Bios and
    use each of the disk in Raid0 mode, which is quite the same as the
    solution without Raid at all. 
   
NetRaid card
      These cards are equiped with an [http://www.ami.com] AMI Megaraid
    chipset and may support the following Raid levels : 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 30
    and 50. Some NetRaid cards, as well as the chipset integrated on the LH3
    and LH4 mother boards are supported by recent version of the Linux kernel
    (2.0.36/2.2.19/2.4.3 typically - don't use 2.0.37/38). 
   
      For the RedHat 5.2 distribution, it's not possible to install the
    system on this type of controler, because it's not detected by the
    installation program. You have to use a specific [../mirror/lh3.img]
    floppy disk . This floppy disk should be used as input to the rawrite
    tool, for example. It works for systems with less than 1 GB of memory. 
   
      For the RedHat 6.0 distribution, you have to manually declare the
    existence of this card as a supplementary SCSI adapter, in order to use
    it directly during the installation. The megaraid driver isn't
    automatically detected. 
   
      To avoid strange messages during the boot printed by the megaraid
    driver, it's necessary to recompile it with the option -DHP (before
    kernel 2.4.2) or -DMEGA_HP_FIX (after). 
   
      For the RedHat 6.1 distribution, the megaraid driver provided by the
    kernel does support on ly the first logical drive. In order to obtain the
    others, please recompile a 2.4.3 standard kernel. 
   
      You have to note that the integrated card of the LH3/4 realises a
    software parity checks and performs thus less efficiently than the
    NetRaid daughter cards. On the other side, LH3000/6000 are equiped with
    an integrated card doing hardware checks. 
   
      In the fourniture of the driver provided by AMI there is a Raid
    management tool megamgr, usable within Linux, and equivalent to the tool
    included in the software embedded on the controler. It's downloadable
    from [http://www.ami.com/support/prodsearch.cfm?InpProdID=17] http://
    www.ami.com/support/prodsearch.cfm?InpProdID=17
   
      In case of problem, a version is available [ftp://
    ftp.medasys-digital-systems.fr/pub/linux/mds/tgz/1e08.zip] there.
   
NetRaid 1M/2M models
      In addition to what is mentionned above, these models require a 1.14
    version of the megaraid driver to work correctly. You may find a version
    of the sources of this driver [../mirror/ami-mr114b.tar.gz] there.
   
      A driver disk for the RedHat distribution is available at the following
    address for the versions [../mirror/dd12mrh62.img] 6.2 and [../mirror/
    dd12mrh70.img] 7.0.
   
NetRaid 4M card
      These cards are equiped with a StrongARM Chipset and correspond to the
    Adaptec card AAC-3642. A driver is available at [http://domsch.com/linux]
    http://domsch.com/linux. The RedHat 7.0 includes in standard the driver
    even if that release of the kernel doesn't handle it normaly. Information
    are also available on the Navigator L.19.00. 
   
Second IDE bus
      On these machines, when the second ide bus is probed by the kernel,
    there is a timeout, which doesn't hurt, but is useless. To avoid it, just
    add to your lilo.conf the following line : 
   
    append="ide1=noprobe"                                            
   
Processors
      To desactivate processors on a Linux server, you need to give an option
    during the boot to the kernel such as : 
   
    Lilo boot: linux maxcpus=3                                       
   
      where the number of processors given in option is less by one of the
    number of processors wanted. For example, here we activate 4 processors. 
   
HA Cluster
      To use a High Availability Custer under Linux, you need to use
    additional software, such as :
   
      + [http://www.rsi.co.uk/products/rsf/rsf-linux.html] RSF-1 (Commercial)
       
      + [http://www.henge.com/~alanr/ha] Linux-HA project (free) and [ftp://
        ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/ext3] ext3
       
   
Multimedia keyboards
      Some of the PCs provided by HP are equiped with a multimedia keyboard.
    You may use the additional keys thanks to the HotKeys daemon (Cf:[http://
    freshmeat.net/projects/hotkeys/] http://freshmeat.net/projects/hotkeys/)

3.2.3. PA-Risc based computer range

  The PA-Risc range is achitectured around a processor designed and realised
by HP. First versions were produced in 1987. Currently the versions are named
PA-8000 (8200, 8500, ...).

  HP has announced at the begining of 1999 its intention to contribute to the
port of Linux on its PA-Risc architecture. This port is a native one, which
is different from a preceding project which used MkLinux on machines based on
PA-7200. The work is currently done with [http://www.thepuffingroup.com] The
Puffin Group bought by Linuxcare, and more precise informations on the status
may be found on the [http://www.parisc-linux.org] official Web site. In
particular, interesting starting points may be found on [http://
www.parisc-linux.org/faq.html] http://www.parisc-linux.org/faq.html and
[http://www.parisc-linux.org/hw.html] http://www.parisc-linux.org/hw.html.
Consult also ESIEE site which participates actively to the port : [http://
mkhppa1.esiee.fr/en/] http://mkhppa1.esiee.fr/en/ Quoting Grant Grundler (12/
05/2000) : "latest update: 32-bit parisc-linux boots and mostly works on most
workstations and servers. Native builds work as does networking and scsi.
User space is being built for both debian (.debs) and RH (.rpms). 64-bit
parisc-linux gets to a login prompt on A500 but isn't useful yet. Lots of
syscalls don't work and I/O subsystem isn't stable. I expect 64-bit to be
better than beta quality by the end of Q12001." 

  The first machines concerned by the port are the A and L Class servers. The
port should be operational in the middle of 2001. Tests are also done on 712
and 715. Other people begin also to work on PA-2.0 machines. The last state
of the port is always available at [http://www.parisc-linux.org/status.html]
http://www.parisc-linux.org/status.html.

  There is on the other side for these machines a Linux project based on the
MkLinux micro-kernel. This project as developped within OSF. The web site
mentionning informations is at [http://www.gr.opengroup.org/mklinux/hppa/
mkpa-rel.html] http://www.gr.opengroup.org/mklinux/hppa/mkpa-rel.html. Links
to more parisc ports are at [http://parisc.workstations.org/] http://
parisc.workstations.org/.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.4. The IA-64 range

  HP is developping in collaboration with Intel a new generation of 64 bits
processors called IA-64. The first processor of this new generation, called
Itanium, should be there during 2001. The initial port of Linux on IA-64 was
published the 2nd of february, 2000 and the sources of the project are
available through [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ia64] ftp://
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ia64. This is the place of the latest
sources for this project. More informations on this topic may be found on
this page of the HP labs : [http://devresource.hp.com/devresource/Topics/IA64
/IA64.html] http://devresource.hp.com/devresource/Topics/IA64/IA64.html and

  HP, as a founding member of the IA-64 Linux project, works on the port of
the kernel, the initial version of gcc, gas, ld and emacs. Another major
contribution of HP to this project is the availability of the software
development kit available at [http://www.software.hp.com/ia64linux] http://
www.software.hp.com/ia64linux. It allows to develop applications as well as
kernel code on Linux/IA32 for IA64 platforms and moreover to test them
through a simulator.

3.2.4.2. Complementary informations

  To boot Linux on this kind of machine, you need to type in the initial
environment >eli linux  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.5. X Terminals

  The HP X terminal range (Entria, Envizex) is usable with a Linux server.
More over, a Linux server may be a boot server for X terminals. To do it, a
certain number of operations are mandatory. 

  We suupose we have a HP-UX machine named hpux, on which is installed
Enware, a Linux server, named linux and an X Terminal with MAC address 08:00:
09:db:8d:1c. The gateway on the network is at IP address 192.168.1.254, and
the DNS name server at 192.168.1.1. 

  Commands to do are :
hpux #cd /opt/hpxt/enware/xthome

3.2.6. The printing product range

3.2.6.1. General points

  Printers may be connected directly to a machine through either a parallel
port (generally), or a serial port, or even (more recently) through an USB
port. They may also be directly wired to the network, for a global access;
this is done thanks to a card put in a slot of the printer, or through the
connexion of the parallel port of the printer to a sharing network box. 

  HP provides such boxes, called JetDirect, which allow thus to share
personnal printers on the network, directly, without going through a machine.
They exist for various network topologies (10 BT, 10/100 BT, Localtalk, 10B2)
and offer the ability to access to the printer directly from machine which
like Linux support the LPD protocol, by using a remote printer in the /etc/
printcap file. The name of the queue to use is then raw.

  An example of /etc/printcap file allowing to access to a printer, equiped
with such a box or card, named lj4000 on the network is given below : 
# REMOTE POSTSCRIPT 1200x1200 a4 {} PostScript Default {}                    
lj4000:\                                                                     
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/lj4000:\                                          
        :rm=lj4000:\                                                         
        :rp=raw:\                                                            
        :if=/var/spool/lpd/lj4000/filter:\                                   
        :mx#0:\                                                              
        :sh:                                                                 

  The configuration access to the box is done either through the WebJetAdmin
tool provided also under Linux now, or by the telnet command. The default
address of these products is 192.0.0.192. To connect to them initially, you
just have to add an IP alias on your network interface, typically by : 
#ifconfig eth0:0 192.0.0.1                                                   

  and a route to that network (if not automatically created) typically by :
#route add -net 192.0.0.0                                                    

  The access to the equipment is thus done simply by :
#telnet 192.0.0.192                                                          

  Please pay attention to have only one such equipment on the network, at the
same time, or you'll have duplicate IP addresses, which always causes
problems. Note that HP manageable network equipments also use the same
default address. The reading of the [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/
mirror/linux/LDP/HOWTO/mini/IP-Alias.html] IP Alias mini HOWTO may be useful
if you don't understand the previous paragraph :-). 

  It is of course possible to access through the network to an HP printer
attached and declared directly on a Linux machine, thanks to the lpd service
for the other Unix clients, through [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa for the
clients of Microsoft systems (Win9x ou WinNTx) or through [http://
www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk] NetAtalk for the MacIntosh clients. 

  At last, [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa offers a tool, smbclient, which
allows to print from a Unix/Linux machine to a printer wired directly on a
Microsoft based PC, without any need to use a JetDirect system. All the
details useful to realize this operation are described in the file example 
smbprint provided with the [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa package and on the
page [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/linux/samba-truc.html] http://
www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/linux/samba-truc.html.

  Communication between a Linux machine and a printer needs also, outside a
network dialog, a discussion with an exchange language between the two
elements. There are a lot of languages of that sort, such as PCL, Postscript
or HPGL. To be able to print correctly, the tool providing the datas to print
has to generate code known by the printer. Filters exist which allow to
easily transform an output in one given format to another one. Thus the
[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost] Ghostscript software authorizes the
transformation of Postscript source in a great variety of output formats, as
indicated by its invocation in the 'Available devices' part :

3.2.8.2. The Digital Sender

  This product is a scanner, able to send the result of the digitalisation
through e-mail, by sending the digitalised document as an attachement in PDF
format. It may so well be used with a Linux (or other) mail server (sendmail,
postfix, ...), as well as with clients reading their messages under Linux,
providing they have a tool to display PDF file such as [ftp://ftp.adobe.com/
pub/adobe/acrobatreader/unix/4.x/linux-ar-405.tar.gz] Acrobat Reader or
[http://www.aimnet.com/~derekn/xpdf/] xpdf.

  The Digital Sender can also send images as black and white or colour TIFF
files. The black and white images work fine, however, there is a problem with
the colour TIFF files. These are sent in an obsolete format which is not
supported by [http://www.libtiff.org] libtiff, which is the basis of support
for the TIFF format for nearly all Linux software. This means that you cannot
directly open colour TIFF images created by the Digital Sender using Linux
software (e.g. The GIMP, ImageMagick).

3.6. HP as an Open Source Software user and contributor

  HP doesn't make a lot of noise in the free software world, even if it is an
actor and also a user for its own IT infrastructure. For example, all the
incoming mail in HP goes through [http://www.postfix.org] PostFix servers

Chapter 4. Solutions and Sizing 

  This chapter proposes an help for sizing NetServers under Linux, depending
on the different kinds of use. 

  You have to consider that exercise as a bit perilous. Indeed, only the
reality allows to test such previsions. Nevertheless, using the experience
acquired by deploying solutions in the past, we can give some useful rules. 

  We may apply a certain number of rules valid for the sizing of classical
Unix servers, considering that CISC systems (the majority in Linux
environment) need 2.5 less times resources in memory than RISC systems, due
to the fact that binaries used are smaller (Intel platforms are for the
moment 32 bits architectures). This has also influences on disk and swap
space. 

  It's obvious you have to consider, whatever the system, bottlenecks of the
solution put in place, because they will determine the weakest link in the
chain. 

  You have to look particularly at the following points : 

  *   The number and the speed of disks (the I/O rate of 10.000 rpm disks may
    go up to 15 MB/s),  
   
  *   The number and the speed of SCSI controlers (the I/O rate of Ultra2 LVD
    of the LC2000 - LH3/4/3000/6000 may go up to 80 MB/s),  
   
  *   The addition of a supplementary SCSI card supported, when adding slow
    peripherals (DAT, DLT, CD writer ...) in order to avoid that the
    controler slow down in compatible mode, and that I/O performanes drop
    significantly. 
   

  You have also to be suspicious of the extensible functions of machines.
Indeed, it's often preferable for a customer to add a new server, rather than
to augment the capacities of the one in place. The first reason is a
financial one, on one side, because the costs of add-ons on an already old
system may be near those of a new system, whose prices are becoming cheaper
and cheaper. And the same for maintenance. On the other hand, technically, it
could be more interesting to benefit from the latest technologies to obtain a
machine more equilibrate and powerful. For example, when Ultra2 LVD was
introduced, it was more interesting to buy a new server to benefit from the
80 MB/s SCSI bus speed, rather than to update a server which had 40 MB/s
Ultra Wide SCSI. This implies that it's interesting to size correctly the
server, from the begining, for the whole forseeable period of life of its use
(typically 3 years nowadays). 

  In the same kind of ideas, you have to examine closely the choice between a
bi-processors and two mono-processors machines. 2 different systems imply 2
disk controlers, 2 disks set, 2 separate RAM busses thus best performances,
but more administration. On the other hand, a unique system renders it
easier, allows for a quicker communication between processors, which could be
necessary for certain applications, but makes the environment more fragile
(more downtime in case of an hardware problem). In fact, there are more
losses intrinsically on a multi-processor model, in communications at the
system level. This question should mainly be considered for the addition of a
processor (necesseraly obsolete) on a machine a posteriori, rather than to
add a new server. 

  On memory aspects, Linux can manage today up to 64 GB in stable kernels.
Linux takes the maximum from the memory you give to it, mainly by the
constitution of a cache disk which improves greatly system performances. You
may thus oversize the quantity of RAM installed, because it's preferable to a
situation where the server would be obliged to swap (which drop performances
dramatically). The minimum RAM size provided on the NetServers (64 or 128 MB)
matches perfectly a normal use of a system, and doesn't need any particular
addition. You have to take in account that there is no graphical environment
used on production servers. Concerning the swap, under Linux, it comes in
addition to the RAM to give the complete virtual memory available for the
server. As a base rule, it's recommanded to give the same amount of swap
space as the amount of RAM, to allow the system to put on disk nearly all the
running processes in case of need. But the rule which exists for System V
Unix (such as HP-UX) consisting of reserving twice the amount of RAM for swap
isn't useful under Linux. You may note that Linux may swap certain inactive
processes to free the maximum RAM possible. So having a system whose swap is
partially used isn't necesseraly a proof of lack of memory, nor lack of
performances. 

  You'll find below recommandations depending of the type of use made by the
HP NetServer under Linux. It's possible to cumulate several functions on the
same server. You'll take care to add in that case the resources needed to
give the services. 

  Some generic rules have to be considered :

  *   We consider that the number of simultaneous users is the same as half
    the whole number of users on the server. 
   
  *   The minimal RAM size needed for a usable Linux server is 32 MB, which
    is less than the minimum amount of RAM available on the NetServers (64
    MB). In case you use X-Window with KDE or Gnome on this machine, you need
    to have 64 MB in supplement, thus 96 MB as a minimum. 
   
  *   The minimal disk size needed for a usable Linux server is 2 GB, which
    is less than the minimum amount of disk available on the NetServers (9
    GB). 
   
  *   In case of use of Raid 1, you have to double the amount of disk space
    useful to obtain the disk space needed. In case of use of Raid 5, you
    need to add 1 disk to obtain the disk space needed. 
   
  *   Except in particular cases (computing server), the amount of swap is
    the same as the amount of RAM. 
   
  *   The minimal processor needed for a usable Linux server is a Pentium
    133, which is less than the minimum processor available on the NetServers
    (Pentium II 450). 
   
  *   Each X-Window user excuting a client on the server uses in average 2
    MB. 
   
  *   It may be useful to add network cards on this type of machine to smooth
    the traffic, depending on the number of clients.

4.1. Linux as file and print server

4.1.1. Linux as file server

  The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per share. In case of a
unique share (users space for example), it leads to a 2 MB consumption per
user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user has 100 MB of disk
space on the server, with an evolution to 200 MB 3 years later. Processor
resources used are relativeley small, an entry level model will be sufficient
from that point of view. We will priviledge the I/O speed with Ultra 2 LVD
SCSI at 80 MB/s, if the budget allows it, and 10.000 RPM disks.

4.1.2. Linux as print server

  The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per printer shared. In
case of a unique share (One printer per user typically), it leads to a 2 MB
consumption per user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user prints
simultaneously files of 5 MB in average, thus we need to have that space
available on the server. Processor resources used are relativeley small, an
entry level model will be sufficient from that point of view.

4.2. Internet/Intranet Linux server

4.2.1. Web Server

  The Web service uses 2.5 MB of RAM, in static mode (simple HTML pages) and
5 MB of RAM in dynamic mode (HTML pages generated from per, PHP, ...) per
user. The disk space needed is function of the nature of the server, knowing
that most of the consumption comes from images. Processor resources used are
important, thus it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency and
the addition of processors, because this type of traffic could be quite well
done in parallel. We will priviledge also the I/O speed with Ultra 2 LVD SCSI
at 80 MB/s, if the budget allows it, and 10.000 RPM disks.

4.2.2. Mail Server

  Generally, this machine is used as both SMTP (sending and reception of
messages) and POP server (keeper of messages and manager of client accesses).
The SMTP Mail service uses 2 MB of RAM per user. The POP Mail service uses 2
MB of RAM per user. The disk space needed becomes more and more important as
long as attachments (images, various documents) take the greatest place in
exchanges via e-mail. We consider in that case that an average mail box size
is 50 MB. Processor resources used are important, thus it could be useful to
consider the increase in frequency and the addition of processors, because
this type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.

+----------------------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.3. Firewall/Proxy/Web-Cache server

  Generally, this machine is both a Firewall server, a proxy (in both
directions) and a cache for the Web because all requests go through it. The
Firewall service uses 1 MB of RAM. The Proxy service uses 0.3 MB per incoming
relay. The Web cache service uses 0.5 MB per user. The disk space needed is
function of the parameters of the cache Web server. In that case, we consider
20 MB per user. Processor resources used are important, due to the analysis
of IP packets. Thus it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency.

+-----------------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.4. Directory server

  Generally, this machine use a software like [http://www.openldap.org]
OpenLDAP to fulfill its goals. The LDAP service uses 1 MB of RAM and 10 kB of
RAM per user. The disk space needed is of the same kind, so 10 kB per user.
Processor resources used are moderated.

4.3. Linux as computing server

  Generally, this machine is extremely stressed, mainly on the processor and
RAM aspects. Sometimes this is combined with intensive I/O needs. We thus
equip such a machine with high-end processors (nowadays Pentium III Xeon)
with the greatest level 2 cache possible (nowadays 2 MB). In RAM, we would
tend to reach the maximum possible, thus 4 GB. For this type of server, we
should adapt the swap such as it covers all the needs in memory required by
the computing codes to execute. There is often no specific constraint on
network performances, except in case of a computing cluster, in which case we
may consider to equip the machines with 100 Mb/s cards with a switch between
them, even with Myrinet or Gigabit products. Typically, an LH4 2*PIII 550MHz
1 GB/2*9GB is the target of this type of server. The choice is extremely
variable depending on the nature of the computation to do. We should
underline that there are processors, such as PA-Risc, much more performant in
floating point computation than today Intel processors (up to 6 times).

4.4. Linux as an office server

  This kind of server is for the moment rare in the free software world. It's
more frequent in Microsoft world, by association with [http://www.citrix.com/
products/metaframe.asp] Metaframe solutions of [http://www.citrix.com/]
Citrix. An office server needs 50 MB of RAM per user. Intrinsically, this
machine has no requirements in term of disk, if it's not at the same time a
file server. Processor resources used are important, thus it could be useful
to consider the increase in frequency and the addition of processors, because
this type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.

Chapter 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

5.1. "How to have more than 1 GB of RAM on my NetServer ?"
5.2. "How to have more than 128 MB of swap on my NetServer ?"
5.3. "How to use the other procesors of my NetServer ?"
5.4. "Is Linux Y2K compatible ?"

5.1. "How to have more than 1 GB of RAM on my NetServer ?"

The following informations are adapted from the [http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/
Linux-MM/more_than_1GB.html] page of Rik van Riel. They concern 2.0.x as well
as 2.2.x kernels. 

  First of all, the IA32 Intel architecture is limited by construction in its
memory management to 4 GB. Space which should be divided into virtual memory
and physical memory. Which means that if you choose to recognize more RAM,
the maximum size for a program decreases. 

  But Linux can't manage more than 1 GB by default. To go above that, in fact
up to 2 GB today, because Linux can't manage more memory for the moment, you
need to modify 2 files provided with kernel sources and recompile it. Those 2
sources are /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386/page.h and /usr/src/linux/arch/
i386/vmlinux.lds.

  >From 2.0.37 and 2.2.12 kernels on, the patch was integrated in the kernel
and may be activated when doing a make config.

  The maximum Ram managed in the i386 version was ported to 64 GB after
2.3.23. 

5.2. "How to have more than 128 MB of swap on my NetServer ?"

Up to the version 2.8x of the util-linux package, the mkswap command could
create swap partitions only up to 128 MB maximum. You then had to create as
much partitions as necessary. Till the 2.9 version, included in standard in
RedHat 6.0 and following distributions, it's possible to create directly swap
partitions up to 2 GB and to 8 partitions. 

5.3. "How to use the other procesors of my NetServer ?"

Multi-processing is supported by Linux operationnaly till the 2.0 version of
the kernel. For a 2.0.x kernel, you have to recompile it and set up the SMP
variable in the Makefile to 1. For a 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernel, you have to set
it up during the make config. For more details, please consult the [http://
www.irisa.fr/prive/mentre/smp-howto] SMP-HOWTO.

5.4. "Is Linux Y2K compatible ?"

Generally, Linux is Y2K compatible. For more informations please consult the
[http://www.linux.org/help/beginner/year2000.html] FAQ.
