1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose of this document

This document lists what I consider to be the essential book-length
references for learning Unix (especially Linux) and how to program under it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. New versions of this document

New versions of the Linux Reading List HOWTO will be periodically posted to
[news:comp.os.linux.answers] comp.os.linux.answers. They will also be
uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including the LDP home page.

You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide Web via the
URL [http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html] http://
sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3. Feedback and Corrections

If you have questions or comments about this document (or just want to
suggest a book that you think should be on it), please feel free to mail Eric
S. Raymond, at <esr@thyrsus.com>. I welcome any suggestions or criticisms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4. Related Resources

For on-line HOWTOs, magazines, and other non-book material, see the Linux
Documentation Project home page.

Some years ago I wrote a less Linux-focused Unix bibliography that may still
be of some interest and retains a certain amusement value. You can find the
Loginataka [http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html] here.

SAGE, the System Administrator's Guild, maintains an excellent [http://
www.usenix.org/sage/sysadmins/books/booklist.html] list of relevant books.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5. Conventions Used In This Document

Comments not in quotes below are either mine, or I have seen no reason to
change them from those of Jim Haynes (previous maintainer of this document).
Comments sent in by others are in quotes, and have the name of the
commentator before them (JH is Jim Haynes).

"See" URLs attached to publishing information point directly into the
publisher's web catalog and typically take you to a page containing a cover
shot, blurbs, and ordering information. Books that don't have these lack them
because the publisher is using frames and the catalog pages can't be
bookmarked.

Topic listings go roughly from the outside in (culture to user-land
programming to kernel programming to hardware). Within sections I have tried
to list the most useful books first insofar as I am familiar with them. It's
just an embarrassing coincidence that this lists one of my books first,
honest! (Suggestions for a better organization cheerfully accepted.)

Linux in 3 months!"

Toxen, 2000, ISBN 0-13-028187-5, Prentice-Hall.

This is excellent work; the standard by which future Linux security books

`If you are one of those users who would like to know how LaTeX can be
extended to create the nicest documents possible without becoming a (La)TeX
guru, then this book is for you' --- from the Preface. Bruce Thompson adds:

LaTeX, provides a large number of examples showing precisely how your
document's layout can be manipulated"

distribution) is in preparation. LaTeX 2.09 is fully supported by LaTeX2e. A
must for anyone wanting to use LaTeX. Provides a gentle introduction to

METAFONT, the companion program to TeX for designing fonts. An excellent work
if you're planning to design your own fonts for use in TeX and LaTeX.
METAFONT is included with the normal TeX/LaTeX distribution." This book is 
definitely not for the faint of heart.

1992, ISBN 0-937175-73-0, O'Reilly & Associates, 607pp..

Linux hews very close to the letter of the POSIX standard (non-conformance is
considered a bug and swiftly fixed). This excellent reference for POSIX is
thus also an excellent reference for the Linux kernel API.

The Linux kernel

The Linux Kernel book, Rémy Card, Èric Dumas, and Frank Mével, 1998, ISBN
0-471-98141-9, John Wiley & Sons.

(Translated from the French language edition of "Programmation Linux 2.0";
same authors; 1997; Éditions Eyrolles; Paris, France.)

A very interesting and informative examination of the operation of the kernel
that fills in the gap between the POSIX interface and "The Design of the Unix
Operating System" and the Linux source code. A good understanding of the
design and operation of a Unix OS is a pre-requisite, but this book is an
excellent help to going beyond that general understanding into actual work.

The primary author is one of the core developers for the ext2 filesystem, and
the Linux Kernel book shows a firm grasp of the matter and clear explanations
and structure. It's surprisingly readable for something working at such a low
level. The book does seem to have suffered a little in the translation to
English -- there are a few typos and grammatical mistakes, but it's quite
readable. (The code example files are charmingly still named in French.)

The book is current to Linux 2.0.35 and foreshadows 2.1 and 2.2. Network
protocol implementations are not covered.


Linux Kernal Hacker's Guide, Edited by Michael K. Johnson, Linux
Documentation Project.

Available on the LDP home page, or directly at [http://linuxdoc.org/LDP/khg/]
http://linuxdoc.org/LDP/khg/.

According to the author, this has been superseded by Alessandro Rubini's book
(see below) but it remains a useful supplement.


Linux Device Drivers, Alessandro Rubini, 1998, ISBN 1-56592-292-1, O'Reilly &
Associates, 442pp..

Everything you need to know about writing device drivers under Linux; kernel
APIs, interrupt handling, the module interface. Includes many examples.

LINUX Kernel Internals, (Second Edition), Michael Beck, Harold Bohme, Mirko
Dziadka, and Ulrich Kunitz, 1998, ISBN 0-201-33143-8, Addison-Wesley, 480pp..

which influenced Linux's design (especially near sockets and networking).
This book covers the 4.4BSD base of BSD/OS, FreeBSD, and NetBSD.

This explains the 386 features for operating system writers. It includes a
chapter on Unix implementation. A lot of the 80386 architecture seems to have
been designed with Multics in mind; the features are not used by DOS or by
Unix.


Programming the 80386, John H. Crawford and Patrick P. Gelsinger, 1987, ISBN
0-89588-381-3, 774pp..

This is the book the Jolitzes used when they ported BSD to the 386
architecture.

A.2. History

This was originally a mini-HOWTO maintained by Jim Haynes. I have changed the
emphasis somewhat, trying to make it more a standalone document and less
reliant on the various USENET bibliographic postings. The unattributed
mini-reviews are mine rather than his.
