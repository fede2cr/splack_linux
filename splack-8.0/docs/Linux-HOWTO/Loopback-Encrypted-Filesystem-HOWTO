  Loopback Encrypted Filesystem HOWTO
  Copyright by Ryan T. Rhea, rhear@cs.winthrop.edu
  v1.1, 29 November 1999

  This document explains how to setup and then use a filesystem that,
  when mounted by a user, dynamically and transparently encrypts its
  contents.  The filesystem is stored in a regular file, which can be
  hidden or named non-conspicuously such that it would most likely be
  overlooked.  This allows for a high level of secure storage of data.

  1.  Before you begin

  This process requires the kernel source code, knowledge of compiling
  this code, and a lot of patience.  I highly recommend having a boot
  disk ready.  Also, be sure to have a backup before you permanently
  store your important data on the encrypted filesystem - it can be
  corrupted like any other filesystem.

  As a minimum, you will have to patch to at least version 2.2.9 of the
  linux kernel before continuing.  There are further instructions on
  applying patches in the ``'' section later in this document.

  2.  Introduction

  The process uses the device '/dev/loop*' (where * can be 0-7 on most
  installations) to mount a loopback filesystem.  The same process can
  be used without encryption to store a linux filesystem on a non-linux
  partition.  There is a HOWTO on this at the LDP site mentioned
  previously.

  Different types of encryption can be used, including XOR, DES,
  twofish, blowfish, cast128, serpent, MARS, RC6, DFC, and IDEA.  The
  program 'losetup' (loopback setup) is what associates your encrypted
  file with a filesystem and it's cipher type.  According to Alexander
  Kjeldaas, who maintains kerneli.org and the international crypto
  patches, DES and losetup are currently incompatible.  This is due to
  differences in the way the two handle parity bits.  There are no plans
  to support DES as it is much more insecure than the other ciphers.

  Twofish, blowfish, cast128, and serpent are all licensed free for any
  use.  The others may or may not have licensing restrictions.  Several
  of them are candidates for the AES standard.  The finalists will
  provide royalty free use of their ciphers worldwide.

  This document uses the serpent algorithm because it is strong yet
  remarkably fast, and it's freely distributable under the GPL.
  According to it's documentation, serpent uses a 128-bit block cipher
  designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen.  It provides
  users with the highest practical level of assurance that no shortcut
  attacks will be found.  The documentation on serpent as well as the
  source code can be found at:


       <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html>


  Also, this document assumes that the ciphers are compiled directly
  into the kernel.  You may install them as modules, but the technique
  is not discussed in this document.  You will have to edit the file
  process is discussed in detail in the kernel compilation HOWTO
  referenced previously.


  3.  Summary

  There are many steps involved in the process.  I will provide ``'' for
  these steps in the next section. I thought it would be nice to provide
  a summary first to provide reference (if you are experienced with
  unix/linux you probably don't need the details anyway).  Here they are
  summarized as follows:


  1. Download the newest international crypto patch (I used



       <http://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/>



  2. Patch the kernel


  3. Run 'config' (or 'menuconfig' or 'xconfig') to configure your are
     scattered.  First of all, before you will see any other options you
     must enable 'Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers'
     under 'Code Maturity level options'.  Under 'Crypto options' enable
     'crypto ciphers' and serpent, but try whatever you want.  Remember
     that DES is known to be incompatible as of 2.2.10.4 - it may never
     be supported at all.  There are several important options to select
     under 'Block Devices'.  These include device support', 'Use
     relative block numbers as basis for transfer functions
     (RECOMMENDED)', and 'General encryption support'.  DO NOT select
     the crypto options under the various network categories.  I will
     not go  any further into configuration of the kernel, it is out of
     the scope of this document and can be found at the LDP site.



  4. Compile the new kernel.



  5. Edit '/etc/lilo.conf' to add the new kernel image.  Run add the
     kernel to the boot loader.



  6. Download the source for the newest 'util-linux' (I used



       <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>



  7. Extract the 'util-linux' source.



  8. Apply the corresponding patch found in your



  9. CAREFULLY read the 'INSTALL' file!  This package contains the
     sources for many system dependent files (important tools such as
     MCONFIG file before compiling these sources have a boot disk and/or
     shotgun ready because your system will be quite confused.
     Basically you want to set almost all of the 'HAVE_*' fields equal
     to yes so that the important authentication tools are not compiled
     and written over.  The tools you do want rebuilt are 'mount' and
     'losetup' to accommodate the new encryption schemes.  I suggest
     that you refer to the ``'' section below for this step.



  10.
     Compile and install the 'util-linux' source



  11.
     Reboot the machine with the new kernel.



  12.
     Edit '/etc/fstab', adding an entry for your mount point as follows:
       ______________________________________________________________________
       /dev/loop0  /mnt/crypt  ext2  user,noauto,rw,loop 0 0
       ______________________________________________________________________



  13.
     Create the directory that will hold your filesystem, as in



  14.
     As the user, create your encrypted file as follows:



       dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/cryptfile bs=1M count=10



  15.
     Run losetup as follows:



       losetup -e serpent /dev/loop0 /etc/cryptfile



  You only have one chance to enter the password, be careful.  If you
  want to double-check your password, you can use the command:



       losetup -d /dev/loop0



  This will deactivate your loop device.  Next you will run losetup
  again to test your password, as follows:



       losetup -e serpent /dev/loop0 /etc/cryptfile



  16.
     Make your ext2 filesystem as follows:


       mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0



  17.
     Now you can mount the encrypted filesystem with:



       mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt/crypt



  18.
     When your done, you want to unmount and protect your filesystem as
     follows:



       umount /dev/loop0
       losetup -d /dev/loop0



  4.  Details

  Kernel Patches:

  You can upgrade from '2.2.x' releases by patching.  Each patch that is
  released for '2.2.x' contains bugfixes.  New features will be added to
  the Linux '2.3.x' development kernel.  To install by patching, get all
  the newer patch files and do the following:



       cd /usr/src
       gzip -cd patchXX.gz | patch -p0



  Repeat xx for all versions bigger than the version of your current
  source tree, IN ORDER.

  The default directory for the kernel source is '/usr/src/linux'.  If
  your source is installed somewhere else, I would suggest using a
  symbolic link from '/usr/src/linux'.



  Editing 'MCONFIG' for the 'util-linux' package compilation:

  The following are excerpts from the 'MCONFIG' file I used to compile
  the 'util-linux' package.  Note that this is fairly specific for my
  setup, which is loosely based on RedHat 5.2.  The point is to make
  sure you don't overwrite any important system tools such as 'login',
  'getty', or 'passwd'.  Anyway, here are the important lines as
  follows:



       ______________________________________________________________________
       CPU=$(shell uname -m | sed s/I.86/intel/)

       LOCALEDIR=/usr/share/locale

       HAVE_PAM=no

       HAVE_SHADOW=yes

       HAVE_PASSWD=yes

       REQUIRE_PASSWORD=yes

       ONLY_LISTED_SHELLS=yes

       HAVE_SYSVINIT=yes

       HAVE_SYSVINIT_UTILS=yes

       HAVE_GETTY=yes

       USE_TTY_GROUP=yes

       HAVE_RESET=yes

       HAVE_SLN=yes

       CC=gcc
       ______________________________________________________________________



  Suggestions:

  Note that you could use any of the eight loopback devices, from to
  '/dev/loop7'.  Use an inconspicuous directory for the mount point.  I
  would suggest creating a folder with 700 permissions inside your home
  folder.  The same goes for the file that holds the data.  I use a
  filename like 'sysfile' or 'config.data' inside the '/etc' folder.
  This will usually get overlooked.

  I created very simple Perl scripts to mount and unmount the filesystem
  with one command.  Write these, make them executable (chmod u+x), and
  store them somewhere in your path.



       ______________________________________________________________________
       #!/usr/bin/perl -w
       #
       #minimal utility to setup loopback encryption filesystem
       #Copyright 1999 by Ryan T. Rhea
       `losetup -e serpent /dev/loop0 /etc/cryptfile`;
       `mount /mnt/crypt`;
       ______________________________________________________________________


  Name the above script 'loop', and then you can be on your way with one
  command ('loop') and a password.



       ______________________________________________________________________
       #!/usr/bin/perl -w
       #
       #minimal utility to deactivate loopback encryption filesystem
       #Copyright 1999 by Ryan T. Rhea
       `umount /mount/crypt`;
       `losetup -d /dev/loop0`;
       ______________________________________________________________________



  Name the second one 'unloop', and then typing 'unloop' will quickly
  deactivate your filesystem.
