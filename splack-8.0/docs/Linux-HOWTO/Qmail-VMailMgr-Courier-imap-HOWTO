  1.  Introduction

  Before you start reading: I am not a native speaker, so there are
  probably spelling/grammatical errors in this document. Feel encouraged
  to inform me of mistakes.

  1.1.  What is Qmail and why should I use it?

  Here is the authors (Dan Bernstein) blurb:

  Qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
  It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
  typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.

  Secure: Security isn't just a goal, but an absolute requirement. Mail
  delivery is critical for users; it cannot be turned off, so it must be
  completely secure. (This is why I started writing qmail: I was sick of
  the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs.)

  Reliable: qmail's straight-paper-path philosophy guarantees that a
  message, once accepted into the system, will never be lost. qmail also
  supports maildir, a new, super-reliable user mailbox format. Maildirs,
  unlike mbox files and mh folders, won't be corrupted if the system
  crashes during delivery. Even better, not only can a user safely read
  his mail over NFS, but any number of NFS clients can deliver mail to
  him at the same time.

  Efficient: On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200000
  local messages per day---that's separate messages injected and
  delivered to mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are
  inherently limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20
  simultaneous deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through
  mailing lists. (This is why I finished qmail: I had to get a big
  mailing list set up.)

  Simple: qmail is vastly smaller than any other Internet MTA. Some
  reasons why: (1) Other MTAs have separate forwarding, aliasing, and
  mailing list mechanisms. qmail has one simple forwarding mechanism
  that lets users handle their own mailing lists. (2) Other MTAs offer a
  spectrum of delivery modes, from fast+unsafe to slow+queued. qmail-
  send is instantly triggered by new items in the queue, so the qmail
  system has just one delivery mode: fast+queued. (3) Other MTAs
  include, in effect, a specialized version of inetd that watches the
  load average.  qmail's design inherently limits the machine load, so
  qmail-smtpd can safely run from your system's inetd.

  Replacement for sendmail: qmail supports host and user masquerading,
  full host hiding, virtual domains, null clients, list-owner rewriting,
  relay control, double-bounce recording, arbitrary RFC 822 address
  lists, cross-host mailing list loop detection, per-recipient
  checkpointing, downed host backoffs, independent message retry
  schedules, etc. In short, it's up to speed on modern MTA features.
  qmail also includes a drop-in ``sendmail'' wrapper so that it will be
  used transparently by your current UAs.

  1.2.  What is VMailMgr and why should I use it?

  VMailMgr is:

  A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d
  which replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication
  module for Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual mailboxes
  by one of three methods:

  ·  IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)

  ·  username-based access (username-virtualuser)

  ·  hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or
     virtualuser:virtual.host)

  You should use it if:

  You prefer to have the users manage their own domains email accounts,
  and store their email in their own home dir.  (This makes setting up
  disk space quotas much easier)

  1.3.  What is Courier-imap and why should I use it?

  Courier-IMAP is:

  A server that provides IMAP access to Maildir mailboxes. This IMAP
  server does NOT handle traditional mailbox files (/var/spool/mail, and
  derivatives), it was written for the specific purpose of providing
  IMAP access to Maildirs.

  You should use it because:

  By default Qmail uses the newer more efficient Maildir format for
  storing email, and Courier-imap is the only imap server I am aware of
  that supports Maildir.  So in short, if you use Qmail, and want imap
  support, you have to use it.

  1.4.  Description of the components

  The email system you hopefully will get after having read this HOWTO
  is composed of several parts, the patched Qmail rpms are key to using
  this document. I recommend using the software versions I tried, they
  will probably compile without many problems and result in a fairly
  stable daemon. If you are courageous, you can try to compile all the
  latest-stuff-with-tons-of-new-features, but  don't blame me if
  something fails ;-). However, you may report other working
  configurations to be included in future versions of this document. All
  of the steps were tested on a RedHat Linux 6.2 box, so the HOWTO is
  somewhat specific, but you should be able to use it for other linux
  distributions as well.

  You do not necessarily have to install in all components. I tried to
  structure this HOWTO so that you can skip the parts you are not
  interested in.

  The document is neither a user manual to Qmail, VMailMgr nor Courier-
  imap. Its prime intention is to save email admins some headaches when
  installing their server and to do my little contribution to the linux
  community.

  1.5.  Working configurations

  Though this document is new, I am pretty confident that it can help
  you get your email system up and running.  Combinations that work for
  me are:

  ·  RedHat 6.2, Linux 2.2.14, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.6,
     Courier-imap 0.31

  ·  Mandrake 7.0, Linux 2.2.13, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.6,
     Courier-imap 0.31



  1.6.  History

  This document was started on April 18, 2000 by Dan Kuykendall after
  several installs of Qmail and VMailMgr.  Then even more setups when
  Courier-imap support was ready.

  2.  Component installation

  2.1.  Preparations

  You have two options

  ·  Get and compile source rpms.  This has the benefit of being able to
     review the source before compiling, and compiling for your specific
     setup.

  ·  Or simply get the binary rpms.  This has the benefit of simplicity,
     and not having to worry about having the necessary libraries
     installed.

     I recommend using Bruce Guenter's rpm releases, since they are well
     patched, and its what I used for building my systems.

  2.1.1.  Get source rpms

  You will need:

  ·  ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.src.rpm -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/ucspi-tcp/>

  ·  daemontools-0.70-1.src.rpm -
     <http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/>

  ·  supervise-scripts-2.4-1.src.rpm -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-
     scripts/>

  ·  qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm -
     <http://em.ca/~bruceg/qmail+patches/>

  ·  vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.src.rpm -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/>

  ·  courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz -  <http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/>

     For Courier-imap you must build the source rpm from the tar file
     (instructions will follow).

  2.1.2.  Get binary rpms

  Qmail does not come in binary form. Such packages are explicitly
  disallowed by the author of Qmail, and frustrating as it may be, I
  understand his reasoning.

  Courier-imap does not come in binary form, unless you want to use the
  one I built. If you want mine, visit
  <http://www.clearrivertech.com/linux/HOWTO/supportfiles/>.

  VMailMgr does not come in binary form that supports Courier-imap,
  unless you want to use the one I built. If you want mine, email me,
  and I will send it.

  ·  ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.i386.rpm -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/ucspi-tcp/>

  ·  daemontools-0.70-1.i386.rpm -
     <http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/>

  ·  supervise-scripts-2.4-1.i386.rpm -
     <http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-scripts/>

  ·  qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm -
     <http://em.ca/~bruceg/qmail+patches/>

  ·  vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.src.rpm -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/>

  ·  courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz -  <http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/>

     For Courier-imap you must build the binary rpm from the tar file
     (instructions will follow) or email me for my binary rpm.

  2.1.3.  Get tarred sources (for non-RPM users)

  If your system does not have, or you do not use RPMS, you can install
  from source.

  ·  ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz -  <http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/ucspi-
     tcp-0.88.tar.gz>

  ·  daemontools-0.70.tar.gz -
     <http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.70.tar.gz>

  ·  supervise-scripts-2.4.tar.gz -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-
     scripts/>

  ·  qmail-1.03.tar.gz -  <http://cr.yp.to/software/qmail-1.03.tar.gz>
     (*)

  ·  vmailmgr-0.96.6.tar.gz -  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/>

  ·  courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz -  <http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/>


       (*) There may be minor differences in these instructions due to the
       use of the standard Qmail package. Please review the documentation for
       Qmail and VMailMgr if any of the files deviates from my instructions.


  2.2.  Install support packages

  2.2.1.  Install with RPMS

  2.2.1.1.  Compiling SRC.RPM's

  Simply run the following command for each package

  rpm --rebuild <package.src.rpm>


  -Example-



  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm --rebuild ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.src.rpm

  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.2.1.2.  Installing RPM's

  If you compiled the source rpms, the binaries will be located in
  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

  rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/daemontools-0.70-1.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/supervise-scripts-2.4-1.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.2.2.  Install with source

  Run the following commands for each package

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make setup check (for ucspi-tcp and daemontools)
    or
    make install (for supervise-scripts)



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf supervise-scripts-2.4.tar.gz
    cd supervise-scripts-2.4
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make setup check or  make install
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.3.  Install Qmail

  2.3.1.  Install with RPMS



  2.3.1.1.  Compiling SRC.RPM's

  After installing the support packages,
  Simply run the following command:

  rpm --rebuild <package.src.rpm>



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm --rebuild qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.3.1.2.  Installing RPM's

  After compiling the source rpms, the binaries will be located in
  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

  rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-pop3d-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-qmqpd-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-qmtpd-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-smtpd-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



    * note start *
    - Remove sendmail and any dependant applications prior to installing Qmail
    - by running the following command for each package
    - rpm -e <packagename>*
    -
    - On my system I had to remove sendmail, so I typed
    - rpm -e sendmail
    * note end *



  2.3.2.  Install with source

  As of this writing Bruce Guenter has not released a tar.gz package of
  his patched qmail. So until Bruce does this, I am having you download
  the standard Qmail package, and forcing you to read the included
  INSTALL file.

  Installing the standard build may cause minor differnces in the
  config, one example that comes to mind is that the init scripts are
  named differently.  This should not cause too much confusion, I just
  want you to be aware.

  Run the following command

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    (Now read the INSTALL file and follow the steps to install Qmail)


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf qmail-1.03.tar.gz
    cd qmail-1.03
    vi INSTALL (Read and follow steps)
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.4.  Install Courier-imap

  2.4.1.  Install with RPMS

  2.4.1.1.  Compiling SRC.RPM's

  Build the courier-imap rpms from the tar file rpm -ta courier-
  imap-0.31.tar.gz


    * note start *
    - This errors out if you compile as root, but if your not root you
    - wont have permissions to /usr/src/redhat. You will want to build as a
    - non-root user, so create a ".rpmmacros" file (for rpm v3 and later) in
    - your home directory containing the line "%_topdir /path/to/home/redhat".
    - Then create your own "redhat" directory containing all the subdirs that
    - /usr/src/redhat contains.
    - You should never build RPMs as root unless you have to.
    * note end *



  * I will mention again, that I have built the binaries, and you can
  get them at *
  *  <http://www.clearrivertech.com/linux/HOWTO/supportfiles/>. *


  2.4.1.2.  Installing RPM's

  After compiling the source rpms, the binary will be located in
  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

    rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/courier-imap-0.31-1.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.4.2.  Install with source

  Run the following command

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz
    cd courier-imap-0.31
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.5.  Install VMailMgr

  2.5.1.  Install with RPMS

  2.5.1.1.  Compiling SRC.RPM's

  Simply run the following command

  rpm --rebuild <package.src.rpm>


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm --rebuild vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.src.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.5.1.2.  Installing RPM's

  If you compiled the source rpm, the binaries will be located in
  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

  rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>



  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/VMailMgr-daemon-0.96.6-1.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________


  2.5.2.  Install with source

  Run the following commands

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf vmailmgr-0.96.6.tar.gz
    cd vmailmgr-0.96.6
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make setup check or  make install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  That should do it.

  3.  Putting it all together

  3.1.  Basic Qmail config

  You will need to add your domains to the
  /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains file in the following format as is
  normal with qmail and VMailMgr.

    domain1.com:user1


  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the Qmail web­
  site <http://www.qmail.org> and the VMailMgr website
  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/VMailMgr/>

  3.2.  Tell Qmail to use VMailMgr for authentication

  By default qmail uses checkpassword for authentication, to tell Qmail
  to use VMailMgr for authentication type the following command:

    echo checkvpw > /var/qmail/control/checkpassword



  3.3.  Setup Courier-imap for VMailMgr

  Copy the VMailMgr auth libs to courier's directory


    cp /usr/bin/authvmailmgr /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/authlib/



  Edit /usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd.config and add authvmailmgr as
  the first entry in AUTHMODULES


  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the Courier-
  imap website  <http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/>

  3.4.  Setup virtual domain with VMailMgr

  With the user account that will be managing the domain go to their
  home dir and type:

    vsetup



  This will setup the users home dir with the necessary structure to
  handle incoming email. You will probably want to create a email
  account by typing


    vadduser emailuser



  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the VMailMgr
  website  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/VMailMgr/>

  3.5.  Starting the daemons

  Start Qmail daemons

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmail start
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop3d start
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/smtp start
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmqpd start (optional)
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmtpd start (optional)



  Start VMailMgr daemon

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/vmailmgrd start



  Start Courier-imap damon

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-imap start



  3.6.  Some considerations left

  Qmail and the Maildirs may cause some email apps that run locally to
  not work. Visit the Qmail website  <http://www.qmail.org> for details
  on email apps that have been patched to work with Maildirs.

  Courier-imap is not as widely used as Cyrus or UWash imap servers.  As
  such, you may suffer from minor incompatibilities. Courier-imap is
  extremely well written, and tries to comply with the imap definition
  even if it means some imap clients wont work well. For details visit
  the Courier-imap website  <http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/>.

  3.7.  Known bugs

  None yet.



  3.8.  The final word

  Im tired, and wonder if anyone will ever use this, but I'm happy its
  done.  I'm sure if you have read this far your tired too. Well, all I
  can hope is that you have Qmail, VMailMgr and Courier-imap working. If
  so, Enjoy!  If not, bummer!

  O.K. readers, you're done for today. Feel free to send me your
  feedback, eternal gratitude, flowers, ecash, cars, oil sources etc.
