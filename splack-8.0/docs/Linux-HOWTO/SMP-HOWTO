  1.  Introduction

  Linux works on SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processors) machines. SMP support
  was introduced with kernel version 2.0, and has improved steadily ever
  since.  The kernel locking granularity is much finer in 2.2.x than in
  2.0.x, which enables better performance when processes are accessing
  the kernel!

  2.  Questions related to any architectures


  2.1.  Kernel Side



  1. Does Linux support multi-threading?  If I start two or more
     processes, will they be distributed among the available CPUs?

     Yes. Processes and kernel-threads are distributed among processors.
     User-space threads are not.


  2. What kind of architectures are supported in SMP?


     From Alan Cox:
        SMP is supported in 2.0 on the hypersparc (SS20, etc.) systems
        and Intel 486, Pentium or higher machines which are Intel
        MP1.1/1.4 compliant. Richard Jelinek adds: right now, systems
        have been tested up to 4 CPUs and the MP standard (and so Linux)
        theoretically allows up to 16 CPUs.

        SMP support for UltraSparc, SparcServer, Alpha and PowerPC
        machines is in available in 2.2.x.


     From Ralf Bächle:
        MIPS, m68k and ARM does not support SMP; the latter two probly
        won't ever.

        That is, I'm going to hack on MIPS-SMP as soon as I get a SMP
        box ...


  3. How do I make a Linux SMP kernel?

     Most Linux distributions don't provide a ready-made SMP-aware
     kernel, which means that you'll have to make one yourself. If you
     haven't made your own kernel yet, this is a great reason to learn
     how.  Explaining how to make a new kernel is beyond the scope of
     this document; refer to the Linux Kernel Howto for more
     information. (C. Polisher)

     In kernel series 2.0 up to but not including 2.1.132, uncomment the
     SMP=1 line in the main Makefile (/usr/src/linux/Makefile).

     In the 2.2 version, configure the kernel and answer "yes" to the
     question "Symmetric multi-processing support" (Michael Elizabeth
     Chastain).

     AND

     enable real time clock support by configuring the "RTC support"
     item (in "Character Devices" menu) (from Robert G.  Brown). Note
     that inserting RTC support actually doesn't afaik prevent the known
     problem with SMP clock drift, but enabling this feature prevents
     lockup when the clock is read at boot time. A note from Richard
     Jelinek says also that activating the Enhanced RTC is necessary to
     get the second CPU working (identified) on some original Intel
     Mainboards.

     AND

     (x86 kernel) do NOT enable APM (advanced power management)! APM and
     SMP are not compatible, and your system will almost certainly (or
     at least probably ;)) crash while booting if APM is enabled (Jakob
     Oestergaard). Alan Cox confirms this : 2.1.x turns APM off for SMP
     boxes.  Basically APM is undefined in the presence of SMP systems,
     and anything could occur.

     AND

     (x86 kernel) enable "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support".
     Some BIOS are buggy as they do not activate cache memory for the
     second processor. The MTRR support contains code that solves such
     processor misconfiguration.



     You must rebuild all your kernel and kernel modules when changing
     to and from SMP mode. Remember to make modules and make
     modules_install (from Alan Cox).


     If you get module load errors, you probably did not rebuild and/or
     re-install your modules.  Also with some 2.2.x kernels people have
     reported problems when changing the compile from SMP back to UP
     (uni-processor).  To fix this, save your .config file, do make
     mrproper, restore your .config file, then remake your kernel (make
     dep, etc.)  (Wade Hampton). Do not forget to run lilo after copying
     your new kernel.

     Recap:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     make config # or menuconfig or xconfig
     make dep
     make clean
     make bzImage # or whatever you want
     # copy the kernel image manually then RUN LILO
     # or make lilo
     make modules
     make modules_install
     ___________________________________________________________________



  4. How do I make a Linux non-SMP kernel?

     In the 2.0 series, comment the SMP=1 line in the main Makefile
     (/usr/src/linux/Makefile).

     In the 2.2 series, configure the kernel and answer "no" to the
     question "Symmetric multi-processing support" (Michael Elizabeth
     Chastain).



     You must rebuild all your kernel and kernel modules when changing
     to and from SMP mode. Remember to make modules and make
     modules_install and remember to run lilo.  See notes above about
     possible configuration problems.



  5. How can I tell if it worked?


      cat /proc/cpuinfo



  Typical output (dual PentiumII):

  ______________________________________________________________________
  processor       : 0
  cpu             : 686
  model           : 3
  vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
  [...]
  bogomips        : 267.06

  processor       : 1
  cpu             : 686
  model           : 3
  vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
  [...]
  bogomips        : 267.06
  ______________________________________________________________________



  6. What is the status of converting the kernel toward finer grained
     locking and multithreading?

     Linux kernel version 2.2 has signal handling, interrupts and some
     I/O stuff fine grain locked.  The rest is gradually migrating. All
     the scheduling is SMP safe.


     Kernel version 2.3 (next 2.4) has really fine grained locking. In
     the 2.3 kernels the usage of the big kernel lock has basically
     disappeared, all major Linux kernel subsystems are fully threaded:
     networking, VFS, VM, IO, block/page caches, scheduling, interrupts,
     signals, etc. (Ingo Molnar)


  7. Does Linux SMP support processor affinity?



     Standard kernel
        No and Yes.  There is no way to force a process onto specific
        CPU's but the linux scheduler has a processor bias for each
        process, which tends to keep processes tied to a specific CPU.


     Patch
        Yes. Look at PSET - Processor Sets for the Linux kernel
        <http://isunix.it.ilstu.edu/~thockin/pset/>:

          The goal of this project is to make a source compatible
          and functionally equivalent version of pset (as defined
          by SGI - partially removed from their IRIX 6.4 kernel)
          for Linux.  This enables users to determine which proces­
          sor or set of processors a process may run on.  Possible
          uses include forcing threads to separate processors, tim­
          ings, security (a `root' only CPU?) and probably more.


     It is focused around the syscall sysmp().  This function takes a
     number of parameters that determine which function is requested.
     Functions include:

     ·  binding a process/thread to a specific CPU

     ·  restricting a CPU's ability to execute some processes

     ·  restricting a CPU from running at all

     ·  forcing a cpu to run _only_ one process (and its children)

     ·  getting information about a CPU's state

     ·  creating/destroying sets of processors, to which processes may
        be bound



  8. Where should one report SMP bugs to?

     Please report bugs to linux-smp@vger.kernel.org.


  9. What about SMP performance?

     If you want to gauge the performance of your SMP system, you can
     run some tests made by Cameron MacKinnon and available at
     http://www.phy.duke.edu/brahma/benchmarks.smp.

     Also have a look at this article by Bryant, Hartner, Qi and
     Venkitachalam that compares 2.2 and 2.3/2.4 UP and SMP kernels :
     SMP Scalability Comparisons of Linux¨ Kernels 2.2.14 and 2.3.99
     <http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/als2000/bryantscale.html>
     (Ray Bryant) (You'll find also a copy here <bryantscale.pdf>)



  2.2.  User Side


  1. Do I really need SMP?

     If you have to ask, you probably don't. :) Generally, multi-
     processor systems can provide better performance than uni-processor
     systems, but to realize any gains you need to consider many other
     factors besides the number of CPU's.  For instance, on a given
     system, if the processor is generally idle much of the time due to
     a slow disk drive, then this system is "input/output bound", and
     probably won't benefit from additional processing power. If, on the
     other hand, a system has many simultaneously executing processes,
     and CPU utilization is very high, then you are likely to realize
     increased system performance.  SCSI disk drives can be very
     effective when used with multiple processors, due to the way they
     can process multiple commands without tying up the CPU. (C.
     Polisher)


  2. Do I get the same performance from 2-300 MHz processors as from one
     600 MHz processor?

     This depends on the application, but most likely not.  SMP adds
     some overhead that a faster uniprocessor box would not incur (Wade
     Hampton).  :)


  3. How does one display mutiple cpu performance?

     Thanks to Samuel S. Chessman, here are some useful utilities:

     Character based:
        http://www.cs.inf.ethz.ch/~rauch/procps.html

        Basically, it's procps v1.12.2 (top, ps, et. al.)  and some
        patches to support SMP.

        For 2.2.x, Gregory R. Warnes as made a patch available at
        http://queenbee.fhcrc.org/~warnes/procps


     Graphic:
        xosview-1.5.1 supports SMP. And kernels above 2.1.85 (included)
        the cpuX entry in /proc/stat file.

        The official homepage for xosview is:
        http://lore.ece.utexas.edu/~bgrayson/xosview.html

        You'll find a version patched for 2.2.x kernels by Kumsup Lee :
        http://www.ima.umn.edu/~klee/linux/xosview-1.6.1-5a1.tgz

     By the way, you can't monitor processor scheduling precisely with
     xosview, as xosview itself causes a scheduling perturbation. (H.
     Peter Anvin)

     And Rik van Riel tell us why:

  The answer is pretty simple. Basically there are 3 processes
  involved:

     a. the cpu hog  (low scheduling priority because it eats
        CPU)

     b. xosview

     c. X


  The CPU hog is running on one CPU. Then xosview wakes up (on
  the other CPU) and starts sending commands to X, which wakes
  up as well.

  Since both X and xosview have a much higher priority than
  the CPU hog, xosview will run on one CPU and X on the other.

  Then xosview stops running and we have an idle CPU --> Linux
  moves the CPU hog over to the newly idle CPU  (X is still
  running on the CPU our hog was running on just before).



  4. How can I enable more than 1 process for my kernel compile?

     use:

     ___________________________________________________________________
             # make [modules|zImage|bzImages] MAKE="make -jX"
             where X=max number of processes.
             WARNING: This won't work for "make dep".
     ___________________________________________________________________



  With a 2.2 like kernel, see also the file
  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/smp.txt for specific instruction.

  BTW, since running multiple compilers allows a machine with sufficient
  memory to use use the otherwise wasted CPU time during I/O caused
  delays, make MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2 actually helps even on uniprocessor
  boxes (from Ralf Bächle).


  5. Why is the time given by the time command inaccurate?  (from Joel
     Marchand)

     In the 2.0 series, the result given by the time command is false.
     The sum user+system is right *but* the spreading between user and
     system time is false.

     More precisely: "The explanation is, that all time spent in
     processors other than the boot cpu is accounted as system time.  If
     you time a program, add the user time and the system time, then you
     timing will be almost right, except for also including the system
     time that is correctly accounted for" (Jakob Østergaard).

     This bug is corrected in 2.2 kernels.



  2.3.  SMP Programming

  Section by Jakob Østergaard.

  This section is intended to outline what works, and what doesn't when
  it comes to programming multi-threaded software for SMP Linux.


  2.3.1.  Parallelization methods


  1. POSIX Threads

  2. PVM / MPI Message Passing Libraries

  3. fork() -- Multiple processes

  Since both fork() and PVM/MPI processes usually do not share memory,
  but either communicate by means of IPC or a messaging API, they will
  not be described further in this section. They are not very specific
  to SMP, since they are used just as much - or more - on uniprocessor
  computers, and clusters thereof.


  Only POSIX Threads provide us with multiple threads sharing ressources
  like - especially - memory. This is the thing that makes a SMP machine
  special, allowing many processors to share their memory. To use both
  (or more ;) processors of an SMP, use a kernel-thread library. A good
  library is the LinuxThreads, a pthread library made by Xavier Leroy
  <http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/> which is now
  integrated with glibc2 (aka libc6).  Newer Linux distributions include
  this library by default, hence you do not have to obtain a separate
  package to use kernel threads.

  There are implementations of threads (and POSIX threads) that are
  application-level, and do not take advantage of the kernel-threading.
  These thread packages keep the threading in a single process, hence do
  not take advantage of SMP.  However, they are good for many
  applications and tend to actually run faster than kernel-threads on
  single processor systems.

  Multi-threading has never been really popular in the UN*X world
  though. For some reason, applications requiring multiple processes or
  threads, have mostly been written using fork(). Therefore, when using
  the thread approach, one runs into problems of incompatible (not
  thread-ready) libraries, compilers, and debuggers.  GNU/Linux is no
  exception to this. Hopefully the next few sections will sched a little
  light over what is currently possible, and what is not.



  2.3.2.  The C Library

  Older C libraries are not thread-safe. It is very important that you
  use GNU LibC (glibc), also known as libc6. Earlier versions are, of
  course possible to use, but it will cause you much more trouble than
  upgrading your system will, well probably :)

  If you want to use GDB to debug your programs, see below.


  2.3.3.  Languages, Compilers and debuggers

  There is a wealth of programming languages available for GNU/Linux,
  and many of them can be made to use threads one way or the other (some
  languages like Ada and Java even have threads as primitives in the
  language).

  This section will, however, currently only describe C and C++. If you
  have experience in SMP Programming with other languages, please
  enlighten us.

  GNU C and C++, as well as the EGCS C and C++ compilers work with the
  thread support from the standard C library (glibc). There are however
  a few issues:


  1. When compiling C or C++, use the -D_REENTRANT define in the
     compiler command line. This is necessary to make certain error-
     handling functions work like the errno variable.

  2. When using C++, If two threads throw exceptions concurrently, the
     program will segfault.  The compiler does not generate thread-safe
     exception code.

     The workaround is to put a
     pthread_mutex_lock(&global_exception_lock) in the constructor(s) of
     every class you throw(), and to put the corresponding
     pthread_mutex_unlock(...) in the destructor.  It's ugly, but it
     works.  This solution was given by Markus Ferch.

  The GNU Debugger GDB as of version 4.18, should handle threads
  correctly. Most Linux distribution offer a patched, thread-aware gdb.

  It is not necessary to patch glibc in any way just to make it work
  with threads. If you do not need to debug the software (this could be
  true for all machines that are not development workstations), there is
  no need to patch glibc.

  Note that core-dumps are of no use when using multiple threads.
  Somehow, the core dump is attached to one of the currently running
  threads, and not to the program as a whole. Therefore, whenever you
  are debugging anything, run it from the debugger.

  Hint: If you have a thread running haywire, like eating 100% CPU time,
  and you cannot seem to figure out why, here is a nice way to find out
  what's going on: Run the program straight from the shell, no GDB. Make
  the thread go haywire. Use top to get the PID of the process.  Run GDB
  like gdb program pid. This will make GDB attach itself to the process
  with the PID you specified, and stop the thead. Now you have a GDB
  session with the offending thread, and can use bt and the like to see
  what is happening.


  2.3.4.  Other libraries

  ElectricFence: This library is not thread safe. It should be possible,
  however, to make it work in SMP environments by inserting mutex locks
  in the ElectricFence code.



  2.3.5.  Other points about SMP Programming


  1. Where can I found more information about parallel programming?

     Look at the Linux Parallel Processing HOWTO
     <http://yara.ecn.purdue.edu/~pplinux/PPHOWTO/pphowto.html>

     Lots of useful information can be found at Parallel Processing
     using Linux <http://yara.ecn.purdue.edu/~pplinux/>
     Look also at the Linux Threads FAQ <http://linas.org/linux/threads-
     faq.html>


  2. Are there any threaded programs or libraries?

     Yes. For programs, you should look at: Multithreaded programs on
     linux <http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~hollow/mthread.html> (I
     love hyperlinks, did you know that ? ;))

     As far as library are concerned, there are:


     OpenGL Mesa library
        Thanks to David Buccarelli, Andreas Schiffler and Emil Briggs,
        it exists in a multithreaded version (right now [1998-05-11],
        there is a working version that provides speedups of 5-30% on
        some OpenGL benchmarks). The multithreaded stuff is now included
        in the regular Mesa distribution as an experimental option.  For
        more information, look at the Mesa library
        <http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html>


     BLAS
        Pentium Pro Optimized BLAS and FFTs for Intel Linux
        <http://www.cs.utk.edu/~ghenry/distrib/>

        Multithreaded BLAS routines are not available right now, but a
        dual proc library is planned for 1998-05-27, see Blas News
        <http://www.cs.utk.edu/~ghenry/distrib/blasnews> for details.


     The GIMP
        Emil Briggs, the same guy who is involved in multithreaded Mesa,
        is also working on multithreaded The GIMP plugins. Look at
        http://nemo.physics.ncsu.edu/~briggs/gimp/index.html for more
        info.



  3.  x86 architecture specific questions


  3.1.  Why it doesn't work on my machine?


  1. Can I use my Cyrix/AMD/non-Intel CPU in SMP?

     Short answer: no.

     Long answer: Intel claims ownership to the APIC SMP scheme, and
     unless a company licenses it from Intel they may not use it. There
     are currently no companies that have done so.  (This of course can
     change in the future) FYI - Both Cyrix and AMD support the non-
     proprietary OpenPIC SMP standard but currently there are no
     motherboards that use it.


  2. Why doesn't my old Compaq work?

     Put it into MP1.1/1.4 compliant mode.

     check "Configure Hardware" -> "View / Edit details" -> "Advanced
     mode" (F7 I think) for a configuration option "APIC mode" and set
     this to "full Table mode". This is an official Compaq
     recommandation. (Daniel Roesen)

     (Adrian Portelli)To do this:

     a. Press F10 when the server boots to enter the System
        Configuration Utility

     b. Press Enter to dismiss the splash screen

     c. Immediately press CTRL+A

     d. A message will appear informing you that you are now in
        "Advanced Mode"

     e. Then select "Configure Hardware" -> "View / Edit details"

     f. You will then see the advanced settings (intermixed with the
        ordinary ones)

     g. Stroll down to "APIC Mode" and then select "Fully Mapped"

     h. Save changes and reboot


  3. Why doesnt my ALR work?

     >From Robert Hyatt : ALR Revolution quad-6 seems quite safe, while
     some older revolution quad machines without P6 processors seem
     "iffy"...


  4. Why does SMP go so slowly? or Why does one CPU show a very low
     bogomips value while the first one is normal?

     >From Alan Cox: If one of your CPU's is reporting a very low
     bogomips value the cache is not enabled on it. Your vendor probably
     provides a buggy BIOS. Get the patch to work around this or better
     yet send it back and buy a board from a competent supplier.

     A 2.0 kernel (> 2.0.36) contains the MTRR patch which should solve
     this problem (select option "Handle buggy SMP BIOSes with bad MTRR
     setup" in the "General setup" menu).

     I think buggy SMP BIOS handling is automatic in latest 2.2 kernels.


  5. I've heard IBM machines have problems


     Some IBM machines have the MP1.4 bios block in the EBDA, allowed
     but not supported below 2.2 kernels.

     There is an old 486SLC based IBM SMP box. Linux/SMP requires
     hardware FPU support.


  6. Is there any advantage of Intel MP 1.4 over 1.1 specification?

     Nope (according to Alan :) ), 1.4 is just a stricker specs of 1.1.


  7. Why does the clock drift so rapidly when I run linux SMP?


     This is known problem with IRQ handling and long kernel locks in
     the 2.0 series kernels.  Consider upgrading to a later 2.2 kernel.

     >From Jakob Oestergaard: Or, consider running xntpd. That should
     keep your clock right on time.  (I think that I've heard that
     enabling RTC in the kernel also fixes the clock drift. It works for
     me! but I'm not sure whether that's general or I'm just being
     lucky)


     There are some kernel fixes in the later 2.2.x series that may fix
     this.



  8. Why are my CPU's numbered 0 and 2 instead of 0 and 1 (or some other
     odd numbering)?

     The CPU number is assigned by the MB manufacturer and doesn't mean
     anything.  Ignore it.



  9. My quad-Xeon system hangs as soon as it has decompressed the kernel

     (Doug Ledford) Try recompiling LILO with LARGE_EBDA support and
     then making sure to always use make bzImage when compiling the
     kernel.  That appears to have fixed the SMP boot hangs here on
     Intel multi-Xeon boards.  However, please note that this also
     appears to break LILO in that the root= option no longer works, so
     make sure you rdev your kernel image at the same time you run lilo
     to make sure that the kernel loads the correct root filesystem at
     boot.

     (Robert M. Hyatt) With 3 cpus, do you have a terminator in the 4th
     slot?


  10.
     During boot machine hang signaling an IOAPIC problem

     Try boot options "noapic" (John Aldrich) and/or "reboot=bios"
     (Terry Shull).


  11.
     My system locks up during heavy NFS traffic

     Try the later 2.2.x kernels and the knfsd patches.  This is
     currently under investigation. (Wade Hampton)



  12.
     My system locks up with no oops messages

     If you are using kernels 2.2.11 or 2.2.12, get the latest kernel.
     For example 2.2.13 has a number of SMP fixes.  Several people have
     reported these kernels to be unstable for SMP.  These same kernels
     may have NFS problems that can cause lockups.  Also, use a serial
     console to capture your oops messages. (Wade Hampton)

     If the problem remains (and the other suggestions on this list
     didn't help either), then you could try the latest 2.3 kernels.
     They have more verbose (and more robust) SMP/APIC code, and
     automatic hard-lockup-prevention code which will produce meaningful
     oopses instead of a silent hang. (Ingo Molnar)

     (Osamu Aoki) You MUST also disable all BIOS related power save
     features.  Example of good configuration (Dual Celeron 466 Abit
     BP6):

     ___________________________________________________________________
      POWER MANAGEMENT SETUP.
        ACPI:              Disabled
        POWER MANAGEMENT:  Disabled
        PM CONTROL by APM: No
     ___________________________________________________________________


  If power management features are activated, some random freeze can
  occur.


  13.
     Debugging lockups

     (item by Wade Hampton)

     A good means of debugging lockups is to get the ikd patch from
     Andrea Arcangeli: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-
     patches

     There are several of debug options, but do NOT use the soft lockup
     option!  For newer SMP boxes, turn kernel debugging then turn on
     the NMI oopser.  To verify that the NMI oopser is working, after
     booting the new kernel, /cat /proc/interrupts and verify that you
     are getting NMIs.  When the box locks up, you should get an OOPS.

     You may also try the %eip option.  This allows the kernel to print
     on the console the %eip address every time a kernel function is
     called.  When the box locks up, write down the first column ordered
     by the second column then lookup the addresses in the System.map
     file.  This works only in console mode.

     Also note that the use of a serial console can greatly facilitate
     debugging kernel lockups, not just SMP kernel lockups!


  14.
     "APIC error interrupt on CPU#n, should never happen" messages in
     logs

     A message like:

     ___________________________________________________________________
     APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
     ... APIC ESR0: 00000002
     ... APIC ESR1: 00000000
     ___________________________________________________________________


  indicates a 'receive checksum error'. This cannot be caused by Linux
  as the APIC message checksumming part is completely in hardware. It
  might be marginal hardware. As long as you dont see any instability,
  they are not a problem - APIC messages are retried until delivered.
  (Ingo Molnar)



  3.2.  Possible causes of crash

  In this section you'll find some possible reasons for a crash of an
  SMP machine (credits are due to Jakob Østergaard for this part). As
  far as I (David) know, theses problems are Intel specific.



  ·  Cooling problems

     >From Ralf Bächle: [Related to case size and fans] It's important
     that the air is flowing.  It of course can't where cables etc. are
     preventing this like in too small cases.  On the other side I've
     seen oversized cases causing big problems.  There are some tower
     cases on the market that actually are worse for cooling than
     desktops.  In short, the right thing is thinking about aerodynamics
     in the case.  Extra cases for hot peripherals are usefull as well.

     Of course you can always go to Radio Shack (or similar) and get
     another fan.  You can use the lm_sensors to monitor the CPU
     temperature of newer PII and PIII processors.  This might help you
     to determine if heat is a problem. (Wade Hampton)



  ·  Bad memory

     Don't buy cheap RAM and don't use mixed RAM modules on a
     motherboard that is picky about it.

     Especially Tyan motherboards are known to be picky about RAM speed.


     There have been some report of 10ns PC100 RAM being sold with
     motherboards where the CPU really needs 8ns RAM. (Wade Hampton)



  ·  Bad combination of different stepping CPUs

     Check /proc/cpuinfo to see that your CPUs are same stepping.


  ·  If your system is unstable, then DON'T overclock it!

     ...and even if it is stable, DON'T overclock.

     >From Ralf Bächle: Overclocking causes very subtle problems.  I
     have a nice example, one of my overclocked old machines
     misscomputes a couple of pixels of a 640 x 400 fractal.  The
     problem is only visible when comparing them using tools. So better
     say never, nuncas, jamais, niemals overclock.



  ·  2.0.x kernel and fast ethernet (from Robert G. Brown)

     2.0.x kernels on high performance fast ethernet systems have
     significant (and known) problems with a race/deadlock condition in
     the networking interrupt handler.

     The solution is to get the latest 100BT development drivers from
     CESDIS Linux Ethernet device drivers site
     <http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/> (ones that define
     SMPCHECK).

  ·  A bug in the 440FX chipset (from Emil Briggs)

     If you had a system using the 440FX chipset then your problem with
     the lockups was possibly due to a documented errata in the chipset.
     Here is a reference

     References: Intel 440FX PCIset 82441FX (PMC) and 82442FX (DBX)
     Specification Update.  pg. 13

     http://www.intel.com/design/pcisets/specupdt/297654.htm

     The problem can be fixed with a BIOS workaround (Or a kernel patch)
     and in fact David Wragg wrote a patch that's included with Richard
     Gooch's MTTR patch. For more information and a fix look here:

     http://nemo.physics.ncsu.edu/~briggs/vfix.html


  ·  DONT run emm386.exe before booting linux SMP

     >From Mark Duguid, dumb rule #1 with W6LI motherboards. ;)


  ·  If the machine reboots/freezes after a while, there can be two good
     BIOS + memory related reasons (from Jakob Østergaard)

  ·  If the BIOS has settings like "memory hole at 16M" and/or "OS/2
     memory > 64MB", try disabling them both. Linux does not always
     react well with theese options.

  ·  If you have more than 64 MB of memory in the machine, and you
     specified the exact number manually in the LILO configuration, you
     should specify one MB less than you actually have in the machine.
     If you have 128 MB, you lilo.conf line looks like:
     append="mem=127M"



  ·  Be aware of IRQ related problems

     Sometime, some cards are not recognized or can trigger IRQ
     conflicts. Try shuffling cards on slots in different ways and
     possibly moving them to different IRQs.

     Contributed by hASCII : removing an " append="hisax=9,2,3"" line in
     lilo.conf allowed using a kernel from the 2.1.xx series with
     activated ISDN + Hisax support. Kernels from the 2.0.xx series
     doesn't make problems like this.

     Try also to set BIOS setup option like "MP 1.4 mode" or "route PCI
     interrupts through IOAPIC", or "OS Type" not set to DOS neither
     Novell (Ingo Molnar).



  ·  Floppy access while sound is active

     If you lockup when trying to access the floppy (for example while
     sound is playing) you may have to edit drivers/pci/quirks.c and set
     /int isa_dma_bridge_buggy = 1; This is a problem with my Dell WS400
     dual PII/300, 2.2.x, SMP (Wade Hampton).



  3.3.  Motherboard specific information

  Please note: Some more specific information can be found with the list
  of Motherboards rumored to run Linux SMP <http://www.nlug.org/smp/>


  3.3.1.  Motherboards with known problems


  ·  none right now



  3.4.  Low cost SMP Linux box (dual Celeron box)

  (Stéphane Écolivet)


  The lowest cost SMP Linux boxes with nowadays buyable processors are
  dual Celeron systems. Such a system is not officially possible
  according to Intel.  Better think about the second generation of
  Celeron, those with 128 Kb L2 cache.


  3.4.1.  Is it possible to run a dual Intel Celeron box ?

  Official answer from Intel: no, Celeron cannot work in SMP mode.

  Practical answer: it is possible, but requires hardware alteration for
  Slot 1 processors.  Alteration is described by Tomohiro Kawada on his
  Dual Celeron System <http://kikumaru.w-
  w.ne.jp/pc/celeron/index_e.html> page.  Of course, this kind of
  modification removes warranties...  Some versions of Celeron processor
  are also available in Socket 370 format.  In that case, alteration may
  just be done on the Socket 370 to Slot 1 adapter or may even be sold
  pre-wired for SMP use. (Andy Poling, Hans - Erik Skyttberg, James
  Beard)

  There is also a motherboard (ABIT BP6) allowing two Celerons in Socket
  370 format to be inserted (Martijn Kruithof, Ryan McCue). ABIT
  Computer BP6 verified tested and native to linux with dual ppga socket
  370 (Andre Hedrick).


  3.4.2.  How does Linux behave on a dual Celeron system ?

  Fine, thank you.


  3.4.3.  Celeron system ?  Celeron processors are known to be easily
  overclockable. And dual

  It may work. However, overclocking this kind of system is not as easy
  as overclocking a mono-processor one. It is definitly not a good idea
  for a production system. For personal use, dual Celeron 300A systems
  running rock-solid at 450 MHz have been reported. (numerous people)


  3.4.4.  And making a quad Celeron system ?

  It is impossible. Celeron processors have nearly the same features as
  basic Pentium II chips.  If you want more than 2 processors in your
  system, you'll have to look at Pentium Pro, Pentium II Xeon or Pentium
  III (?) boxes.


  3.4.5.  What about mixing Celeron and Pentium II processor ?

  A system using a "re-enable" Celeron processor and a Pentium II
  processor with the same steppings may theorically work.

  Alexandre Charbey as made such a system:

  ·  Asus P2B-D motherboard, proc 1: Celeron 366, proc 2: Pentium II
     400@266

  ·  66Mhz and 75Mhz bus frenquencies where functionnal

  ·  the fastest processor (in this case the Celeron) should be put on
     the second slot. Swapping processors (fatest first) leads to quick
     failure.


  4.  Sparc architecture specific questions



  4.1.  Which Sparc machines are supported ?

  Quoting the UltraLinux <http://ultra.linux.cz/> web page (only SMP
  systems):

  ·  UltraSPARC PCI based workstations: Ultra60, Ultra450

  ·  UltraSPARC SBUS based servers: Enterprise 1, 2, 150

  ·  UltraSPARC SBUS based large servers: Enterprise 3000, 4000, 5000,
     6000, 10000

  ·  UltraSPARC PCI based servers: Enterprise 250, 450

  ·  SPARC sun4m SMP machines (Anton Blanchard)

  ·  Starfire E10000 <http://linuxcare.com.au/anton/e10000/>

  UltraLinux has ran on a 14 CPUs machine (see the dmesg output
  <http://lwn.net/1998/1210/a/dm-sparc.html>) and on a Starfire E10000
  with 24 CPUs (see the dmesg output
  <http://linuxcare.com.au/anton/e10000/dmesg_24.shtml>).


  4.2.  Specific problem related to Sparc SMP support

  (David Miller) There should not be any worries.

  The only known problem, and one we don't intend to fix, is that if you
  build an SMP kernel for 32-bit (ie. non-ultrasparc) systems, this
  kernel will not work on sun4c systems.


  4.3.  SMP specific limit with current kernel (2.2)

  (David Miller) There is a bug in the include/linux/tasks.h header
  file, it needs to define NR_CPUS to 64 on UltraSparc as this is the
  upper limit for the hardware we support :-)


  5.  PowerPC architecture specific questions



  5.1.  Which PPC machines are supported ?


  ·  PowerSurge boards (including UMAX s900)

  ·  PowerMac

  ·  Motorola MTX: support under developement. Patches not yet
     integrated into the main kernel (Troy Benjegerdes)

  (Cort Dougan) Not supported: PPC RS/6000 systems



  5.2.  Specific problem related to PPC SMP support

  Nothing. Usual SMP compiling (see above). As usual, be aware, modules
  are specific either for UP or SMP. Recompile them. (Paul Mackerras)


  6.  Alpha architecture specific questions



  6.1.  Which Alpha machines are supported ?

  (Geerten Kuiper) SMP works for most, if not all, AXP servers.

  (Jay A Estabrook) SMP does seem to work on most of our [Compaq] boxes
  with 2 or more CPUs. That includes :

  ·  AS2000/2100 (SABLE)

  ·  AS4000/4100 (RAWHIDE)

  ·  DS20 (DP264)

  ·  GS320 (see the bootlog for a 31 CPUs machine
     <http://lwn.net/daily/gs320.php3>)

  It does not include :

  ·  AS2100A (LYNX)

  ·  TurboLaser bigboys (8200/8400)

  (Alpha Processor Inc) SMP support has been qualified for all API SMP
  systems starting from later 2.2-series kernels (approximately kernel
  2.2.7).  At the time of writing, that is :

  ·  DP264

  ·  UP2000

     See API's support website <http://www.alpha-
     processor.com/support/index.shtml> for more info.


  6.2.  Specific problem related to Alpha SMP support

  None (really ? :-)

  8.2.  Concepts


  ·  Data Races

     A data race happens when to processes want to modify a shared
     variable concurrently without protecting themselves from the effect
     of the other process.

     Let A a shared variable. Let P1 and P2 two processes that access
     this variable. Those two processes are making the same following
     operation: "read A in tmp variable (local to the precess); do tmp =
     tmp + 1 ; write tmp in A". If the A variable is not protected by a
     lock, resulting executions could not correspond to what is
     espected. For example, here is two examples if one do not lock A:

     case #1:
     A=0
     P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
     P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 0)
     P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
     P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 1)
     P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
     P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 1)



  case #2:
  A=0
  P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
  P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
  P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
  P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 1)
  P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 2)
  P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 2)



  To avoid this kind of problem, one uses a lock:



  A=0:
  P1: lock A
  P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
  P2: lock A (so P2 is blocked)
  P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
  P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
  P1: unlock A (so P2 is unblocked)
  P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 1)
  P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 2)
  P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 2)
  P2: unlock A



  ·  Deadlock

     This is an inter-blocking that occurs when two processes want to
     access at shared variables mutually locked. For example, let A and
     B two locks and P1 and P2 two processes:


     P1: lock A
     P2: lock B
     P1: lock B (so P1 is blocked by P2)
     P2: lock A (so P2 is blocked by P1)


  Process P1 is blocked because it is waiting for the unlocking of B
  variable by P2. However P2 also needs the A variable to finish its
  computation and free B. So we have a deadlock.

  In this example, the problem is very simple. But imagine what can
  happen in a 2 millions of lines of code (like the linux kernel) with
  hundreds of locks. :-)
