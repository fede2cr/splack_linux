About this HOWTO

Purpose / Scope of this HOWTO

   This document was started on Aug 26, 1999 by Mark F. Komarinski after
   two day's worth of frustration getting tools to work. If even one LDP
   author is helped by this, then I did my job.
   
   The newest version of this can be found on my homepage
   [51]http://www.cgipc.com/~markk in its SGML source. Other versions may
   be found in different formats at the LDP homepage
   [52]http://www.linuxdoc.org.
   
   There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement without
   actually writing code. One of the most important is writing
   documentation, allowing each person to share their knowledge with
   thousands of others around the world. This HOWTO is designed to help
   you get familiar with how the LDP works, and what tools you'll need to
   write your own HOWTO.

About the LDP

   The following is an excerpt from the LDP Manifesto
   ([53]http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html)
   
   The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) is working on developing free,
   high-quality documentation for the GNU/Linux operating system.The
   overall goal of the LDP is to collaborate in all of the issues of
   Linux documentation. This includes the creation of "HOWTOs" and
   "Guides". We hope to establish a system of documentation for Linux
   that will be easy to use and search. This includes the integration of
   the manual pages, info docs, HOWTOs,and other documents.

Introduction to the LDP and SGML

The LDP

   The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) was started to provide new users
   a way of getting information quickly about a particular subject. It
   not only contains a series of books on administration, networking, and
   programming, but has a large number of smaller works on individual
   subjects, written by those who have used it. If you want to find out
   about printing, you get the [60]Printing HOWTO. If you want to do find
   out if your Ethernet card works with Linux, grab the [61]Ethernet
   HOWTO, and so on. At first, many of these works were in text or HTML.
   As time went on, there had to be a better way of managing these
   documents. One that would let you read it from a web page, a text file
   on a CD-ROM, or even your hand-held PDA. The answer, as it turns out,
   is SGML.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
SGML

   The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a language that is
   based on embedding codes within a document. In this way, it is similar
   to HTML, but there is where any similarities end. The power of SGML is
   that unlike WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get), you don't define
   things like colors, or font sizes, or even some kinds of formatting.
   Instead, you define elements(paragraph, section, numbered list) and
   let the SGML processor and the end program worry about placement,
   colors, fonts, and so on. HTML does the same thing, and is actually a
   subset of SGML. SGML has really three parts that make it up. First is
   the Structure, which is what is commonly called the DTD, or Document
   Type Definition. The DTD defines the relationship between each of the
   elements. The DocBook DTD, used to create this document, is an example
   of this. The DTD lists the rules that the content must follow. Second
   is the DSSSL or Document Style Semantics and Specification Language.
   The DSSSL tells the program doing the rendering how to convert the
   SGML into something that a human can read. It tells the renderer to
   convert a <table> tag into 14 point bold if it is going to RTF format,
   or to turn it into a <h1> tag if you're going to HTML. Finally there
   is the Content, which is what gets rendered by the SGML processor and
   is eventually seen by the user. This paragraph is content, but so
   would a graphic image, table, numbered list,and so on. Content is
   surrounded by tags to separate out each element.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Why SGML instead of HTML or other formats?

   SGML provides for more than just formatting. You can automatically
   build indexes, table of contents, and links within the document or to
   outside. The Jade and OpenJade packages also let you export (I'll call
   it render from here on) SGML to LaTeX, info, text, HTML, and RTF. From
   these basic formats, you can then create other formats such as MS
   Word, PostScript, PDF and so on.Programs like LyX allow you to write
   in TeX format, then export it as SGML and render from SGML to whatever
   you chose. In the end, SGML is more concerned about the way elements
   work instead of the way they look. A big distinction,and one that will
   let you write faster, since you don't have to worry about placement of
   paragraphs, font sizes, font types, and so on.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
For New Authors

   If you are a new to the LDP and want to pick up an unmaintained HOWTO
   or write a new HOWTO or mini-HOWTO document, contact the HOWTO
   coordinator at <[62]ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org>. This is to make
   sure the HOWTO coordinator can know who is working on what
   documentation.
   
   Once that part is complete, you may write your documentation in the
   format of your choice and submit a draft to
   <[63]ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org>and the draft will be reviewed by
   an LDP volunteer. In a few short days you will get the draft and
   comments from the volunteer. After applying the comments,you may send
   this version to the ldp-submit list again for final submission into
   the LDP.
   
   At this point, another LDP volunteer will translate your document into
   DocBook and send you the finished DocBook document. From here on, all
   submissions to the LDP has to be in DocBook format. If you have markup
   questions, you may ask the volunteer who assisted you, or ask the LDP
   DocBook list.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Mailing Lists

   There are a few mailing lists to subscribe to so you can take part in
   how the LDP works. First is <[64]ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org>,
   which is the main discussion group of the LDP. To subscribe, send a
   message with the subject reading "subscribe" to
   <[65]ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org>. To unsubscribe, send an
   e-mail with the subject of "unsubscribe" to
   <[66]ldp-discuss-request@lists.linuxdoc.org>.
   
   Another list is the <[67]ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org> list, which
   is for markup or other questions about DocBook itself. If you run into
   trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your question here
   for answers. You can subscribe to the DocBook list by sending a
   "subscribe"message to <[68]ldp-docbook-request@lists.linuxdoc.org>.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
The tools

   In this section, we will cover some of the tools that you'll need or
   want to use to create your own LDP documentation. I'll describe them
   here, and better define them later on, along with how to install them.
   If you use some other tool to assist in writing LDP, please let me
   know and I'll add a blurb here for it.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
DSSSL

   The Normal Walsh version is required, the LDP is optional.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Norman Walsh DSSSL

   [69]http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/db152.zip
   
   The Document Style Semantics and Specification Language tells jade how
   to render a SGML document into print or online form. The DSSSL is what
   converts a title tag into an <H1> tag in HTML, or bold, 14 point Times
   Roman for RTF, for example. Documentation for DSSSL is located at
   [70]http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/db152d.zip.Note that modifying the
   DSSSL doesn't modify DocBook itself. It merely changes the way the
   rendered text looks. The LDP uses a modified DSSSL that provides for a
   table of contents.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
LDP DSSSL

   [71]http://metalab.unc.edu/gferg/ldp/ldp.dsl
   
   The LDP DSSSL requires the Norman Walsh version (see above) but is a
   slightly modified DSSSL to provide things like a table of contents.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
DocBook DTD (version 3.1)

   Required - [72]http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/3.1/docbk31.zip
   
   The DocBook DTD defines the tags and structure of a DocBook SGML
   document. Modifying the DTD, such as adding a new tag, doesn't make it
   DocBook anymore.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Jade

   Jade and OpenJade are two of the programs that do most of the
   rendering and validation of code based off the DTD and DSSSL. One of
   the following is required and should be installed after the DTD and
   DSSSL have been installed.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Jade

   [73]ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/jade/jade-1.2.1.tar.gz
   
   Jade is the front-end processor for SGML. It uses the DSSSL and
   DocBook DTD to perform the verification and rendering from SGML into
   the target format.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
OpenJade

   [74]http://openjade.sourceforge.net/
   
   An extension of Jade written by the DSSSL community. Some applications
   require jade, but are being updated to support either software
   package.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Jade wrappers

   These tools are optional and may be installed after Jade, the DSSSL,
   and DTD have been installed.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
sgmltools-lite

   [75]http://sgmltools-lite.sourceforge.net/
   
   This is the successor to the sgmltools project, which has officially
   been disbanded for over a year. Since then, Cees de Groot has created
   a slightly different project, which acts as a wrapper to the jade SGML
   processor. It hides much of the ugliness of syntax. This author was
   able to install the old sgmltools package followed by the
   sgmltools-lite and could format this document quite easily. There's
   even a man page for sgmltools showing syntax.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Cygnus DocBook Tools

   May be Red Hat specific - [76]http://www.redhat.com/
   
   Red Hat distributes three packages, starting with the 6.2 release,
   that include DocBook support and some tools. The tools are easily
   installed, allowing you to focus more on writing than wrestling with
   the tools. TeTex, Jade, and JadeTeX must be installed first. All three
   of these packages are available on the installation CD.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Editing tools

   The following tools may be used to create, edit, or validate your
   HOWTO.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
LyX

   [77]http://www.lyx.org/
   
   LyX provides the power of writing SGML with the ease-of-use of a
   regular word processor. It's not a WYSIWYG program, but more WYSIWYM
   (What You See Is What You Mean) application, since what you see on the
   screen isn't necessarily what happens after the SGML processor is done
   with it. The display that LyX provides is similar to, but not exactly
   like, what the output from jade would look like. However, it's close
   enough for you to see the flow of the document. Sections and
   subsections are numbered and put in bold, and different fonts are used
   to signify things like <code> or <url> tags. Most tags are hidden from
   the main LyX window while you edit, since LyX writes in TeX, then
   exports the TeX to SGML.
   
   Figure 1. LyX screen shot
   
   LyX doesn't show tags, but reformats the text based on the tag being
   used.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Emacs (PSGML)

   Optional - [78]http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lenst/about_psgml/
   
   Emacs has an SGML writing mode called psgml that is a major mode
   designed for editing SGML and XML documents. It provides "syntax
   highlighting" or "pretty printing" features that make SGML tags stand
   out, a way to insert tags other than typing them by hand, and the
   ability to validate your document while writing.
   
   For users of Emacs, it's a great way to go, and many believe it to
   allow more versatility than any other SGML documentation tool. It
   works with DocBook,LinuxDoc and other DTDs equally well.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
VIM

   [79]http://www.vim.org
   
   No mention of Emacs is complete without talking about vi. The VIM (Vi
   IMproved)editor has the functionality of regular vi, but also has an
   SGML mode that will color-coordinate your screen to show where tags
   are.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
WordPerfect 9 (Corel Office 2000)

   [80]http://www.corel.com/
   
   WordPerfect 9 for the MS Windows platform has support for SGML and
   DocBook 3.0. WordPerfect 9 for Linux has no SGML capabilities.
   
   This is the least expensive of the commercial applications that
   support SGML.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
sgedit

   [81]http://www.tksgml.de/
   
   The sgedit program allows you to visually edit SGML files. It has the
   advantages of not needing to know Emacs or VI before starting, and is
   cross-platform, working in both Windows and Linux. It's a commercial
   application, but pricing has not been set. There will be free licenses
   for private and academic use.
   
   Along with visual editing, sgedit will also validate documents on
   loading, and on demand by using the Document->Validate command.
   
   The screen shot of the sgedit program shows a tree on the left side
   that has the SGML document in a hierarchy, while the right side shows
   the document. Tags are shown with a grey background.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Other/Reference

   The items in this section are reference books or other utilities that
   can't quite be categorized (yet).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
DocBook: The Definitive Guide

   [82]http://www.docbook.org/
   
   This book was released by O'Reilly in October 1999, and is a great
   reference to DocBook. I have not found it to be a great practical
   book, and much of the emphasis is on XML, but the DocBook tags for
   version 3.1 are all listed in a handy format. You can pick it up at
   the book vendor of choice. The entire book is also available online
   (in HTML and SGML formats) at the above URL.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Aspell

   Optional - [83]http://aspell.sourceforge.net/
   
   This spell checking application can work around SGML tags, and only
   spell check the content within the tags. Default spell checkers like
   ispell will try to spell check the tags, causing errors at every new
   tag.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Getting Started with DocBook

   This section covers the new method of writing LDP documentation, using
   the DocBook 3.1 DTD. We'll cover getting, installing, and using tools,
   along with an introduction to DocBook tags. Since there are over 300
   DocBook tags, we won't cover them all here. Really interested readers
   can go to [84]http://www.docbook.org for more information.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Downloading and installing the tools

Manual using jade/OpenJade

   This is the quick and dirty way that should work for all
   distributions, no matter what distribution you're using.
   
    1. Create a base directory to store everything such as
       /usr/local/sgml/. We'll call this $_toolroot from here on.
    2. Install Jade, DocBook DTD, and DSSSL such that the base of each is
       under $_toolroot (creating $_toolroot/jade-1.2.1, $_toolroot/dtd,
       $_toolroot/dssl)
    3. You'll need to set the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to
       the catalogs that you have under$_toolroot. You can do this with
       the command:bash$ export SGML_CATALOG_FILES =
       $_toolroot/dtd/docbook.cat:$_toolroot/dsssl/docbook/catalog:$_tool
       root/jade-1.2.1/dsssl/catalog
    4. Now you can start using Jade. To create individual HTML files:
       $_toolroot/jade-1.2.1/jade/jade -t sgml -i html -d
       $_toolroot/dsssl/docbook/html/docbook.dsl howto.sgml
    5. To create one large HTML file, add -V nochunks to the jade
       command.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
sgmltools

   Unlike previous versions of sgmltools, you will require sgmltools
   version 2.x for use with DocBook. Since some major distributions ship
   with sgmltools 1.x, you'll need to remove the sgmltools 1.x package
   and install either a 2.0 version, or a CVS version. To get the latest
   CVS source code version, you can use the following set of commands:
bash$ CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.sgmltools.org:/home/cvs
bash$ export CVSROOT
bash$ cvs login
bash$ cvs -z6 get sgmltools

   The CVS password is 'cvs'. Once downloaded, You can just use
bash$ ./compile
bash$ make
bash# make install

   to install sgmltools. For Red Hat-based systems (using RPM) you can
   use the rpmfind command to get the latest sgmltools. The rpmfind
   program is available at [85]http://www.rpmfind.net/. Make sure you get
   sgmltools and not sgml-tools, as the latter is sgml-tools 1.0.9 and
   only works with LinuxDoc documents. For Debian-based systems, running
   2.2 "Potato" and above, apt-get will retrieve the right package for
   you:
bash# apt-get install sgmltools-2

   As with Red Hat Linux, the sgml-tools package is outdated. Be sure to
   get sgmltools-2.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Cygnus DocBook Tools

   These tools are provided with Red Hat 6.2. Make sure the following
   packages are installed:
   
     * sgml-common
     * docbook
     * stylesheets
       
   Red Hat has the latest version on their web site:
   [86]http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2000022-01.html.
   
   Download/get/sneakernet the RPMs to your machine and install in the
   usual manner (become root, then rpm -Uvh filename). Once the RPMs are
   installed, you can use the following commands to render DocBook:
bash$ db2html filename

   Renders DocBook into HTML. A subdirectory with the filename (minus the
   .sgml extension) is created and the HTML files are placed there.
bash$ db2pdf filename

   Renders DocBook into a PDF file.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Writing SGML by hand

   Most of this is covered by Jorge Godoy's Using DocBook document. Those
   interested can read it
   at[87]http://metalab.unc.edu/godoy/using-docbook/using-docbook.htmlfor
   writing DocBook using your favorite text editor.
   
     If you write SGML by hand: SGML has over 300 tags, and uses tags
     much more heavily than HTML. It's recommended that you use an
     existing HOWTO as a template and see how other authors have
     written. It's also recommended that you use a user-friendly editor
     like PSGML or WordPerfect for Windows, as it lists many of the tags
     that are available.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Writing SGML using LyX

New documents

   You can easily start a new HOWTO using LyX. Use the File->New From
   Template... menu command to bring up the template listings. Select
   Templates on the right side of the screen, then select
   docbook_template.lyx in the file listing. Select OK, and you'll have a
   new document. Fill in the items, such as title, abstract, and author
   name, then start writing.

Existing documents

   If you have an already-existing LyX, TeX, or text document, you can
   import it into LyX with the File->import command. Once the file is
   imported, go to Layout->Document... In the popup window, under Style,
   select SGML (DocBook Article). You'll be asked if you want to convert
   all text over, and say Yes. You will need to re-apply most tags, but
   it's a fairly simple matter of selecting text and changing the style.
   Many LyX functions have a keyboard shortcut to assist you.

Exporting documents to SGML

   Once your document is written or converted, save it in LyX format.
   This will allow you to edit future versions easily. Then, go to
   File->Export->as DocBook... and the file will be exported in DocBook.

Writing SGML using PSGML

Introduction

   If you have installed a recent distribution, you may already have
   PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check, start Emacs and look for
   the PSGML documentation (C-himpsgml).
   
   From here on, we assume you have PSGML installed for use with a recent
   version of GNU Emacs. If that all went by too fast for you, see the
   free chapter from Bob Ducharme's SGML CD book:
   [88]http://www.snee.com/bob/sgmlfree/.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Updating your .emacs to use PSGML

   If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open a .sgml file
   and be ready for SGML editing, make sure PSGML can find the DocBook
   DTD. If your distribution already had PSGML set up for use with GNU
   Emacs, you probably do not have to do anything to get this to work.
   Otherwise, you may need to set an environment variable that tells
   PSGML where to look for the SGML catalog (the list of DTDs).
   
   For example:
bash$ export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/catalog

   Then add something like the following to your .emacs file:
;; *******************************************************************
;; set up psgml mode...
;; use psgml-mode instead of emacs native sgml-mode
;;

(autoload 'sgml-mode "psgml" "Major mode to edit SGML files." t )
(setq auto-mode-alist
  (append
  (list
    '("\\.sgm$" . sgml-mode)
    '("\\.sgml$" . sgml-mode)
    )
  auto-mode-alist))

;; set some psgml variables

(setq sgml-auto-activate-dtd t)
(setq sgml-omittag-transparent t)
(setq sgml-balanced-tag-edit t)
(setq sgml-auto-insert-required-elements t)
(setq sgml-live-element-indicator t)
(setq sgml-indent-step nil)

;; create faces to assign to markup categories

SGML Smoke Test

   Try the following smoke test. Start a new file, /tmp/test.sgml for
   example, and enter the following:
<!DOCTYPE test [
<!ELEMENT test - - (#PCDATA)>
]>

   Enter C-cC-p. If Emacs manages to parse your DTD, you will see Parsing
   prolog...done in the minibuffer. Try C-c C-e RETURN to insert a <test>
   element. If things are working correctly, you should see the following
   in Emacs:
<!DOCTYPE test [
<!ELEMENT test - - (#PCDATA)>
]>
<test></test>
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Writing a New HOWTO in DocBook

   Start a new file for your HOWTO and enter the following:
<!DOCTYPE ARTICLE PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN">

   EnterC-cC-pand hold your breath. If everything goes as planned, you
   will see Emacs chewing for a few seconds and then Parsing
   prolog...done in the minibuffer.
   
   At this point, enterC-cC-eRETURN to insert an <article> element and
   proceed to write your HOWTO.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Quick Reference for Emacs with PSGML

   See Nik Clayton's primer for FreeBSD documentation:
   [89]http://www.freebsd.org/tutorials/docproj-primer/psgml-mode.html
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Style guides

   This section contains notes on conventions that the LDP has agreed to
   in order to give all LDP documents a similar look and feel. You should
   keep these guides in mind when writing.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Date formats

   The <pubdate> tag in your header should be in the following format:
v1.0, 21 April 2000
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Graphics formats

   When submitting graphics to the LDP, please submit one set of graphics
   in .eps, and another in either .gif or .jpg. Be aware of the patent
   issues with .gif, but it makes slightly better pictures then .jpg.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
DocBook Versions

   Only DocBook 3.1 is supported by the LDP at this time. DocBook 4.0 is
   under consideration. Many 3.1 documents can be converted to 4.0 easily
   by avoiding the use of depreciated tags.
   
   When writing your DocBook header, it should look like this:
<!doctype article public "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN">
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Depreciated Tags

   Tags listed in DocBook: The Definitive Guide as depreciated are
   discouraged for use in LDP documentation. Some ways to use newer tags
   are listed in the tip and tricks section.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Tag Minimization

   Tag minimization is using </> instead of the full end of a tag (such
   as </para>. Since this makes the document more confusing for future
   authors and LDP members, and is not allowed in XML DocBook, please
   refrain from this practice.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Conventions

   Conventions for different kinds of text is as follows:
   
   If you're going to show the use of a command, format the command so it
   looks like a user's command line. The prompt must contain the shell
   type (bash, tcsh, zsh, etc) followed by a $ for commands to be run as
   a normal (non-root) user or a # for a root user.
   
   A command would then look like this:
bash$ command "run as a normal user"
bash# command "run as a root user"
tcsh# setenv DISPLAY :0.0
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Tips and Tricks with DocBook

   This section covers a few quirks of DocBook that you may run into when
   writing your documents.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Including Images

   If you plan on including images in your HOWTOs, you can now do this,
   as LinuxDoc didn't support images. Here's a sample way of including an
   image in your HOWTOS:
<figure>
<title>LyX screen shot</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.eps" format="eps"></imageobject
>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="lyx_screenshot.jpg" format="jpg"></imageobject
>
<textobject><phrase>Screen shot of the LyX document processing program</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

   This is a better way than using <graphic> for two reasons. First,
   <graphic> will be removed in DocBook 5.0 in favor of the <mediaobject>
   tag. So you may as well get started with the right way now. Second,
   <mediaobject> allows for different kinds of media based on what the
   output is. In this example, the first <imageobject> is an encapsulated
   PostScript(eps) file for use with formats derived from TeX such as
   DVI, PS, and PDF. The second <imageobject> is a JPEG image for visual
   display, mostly for HTML output. The <textobject> is presented if the
   output doesn't support graphics (TXT). Think of it as an <alt> tag.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Naming separate HTML files

   By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML processor will
   assign arbitrary names to the resulting files. This can be confusing
   to readers who may bookmark a page only to have it change, or so you
   know what files are what. Whatever your reasoning, here's how to make
   separate files named the way you want:
   
   In your first <article> tag (which should be the only one) include an
   id parameter and call it index. This will make your tag look like
   this:
<article id="index">

   On the first <sect1> tag, do not modify it, as it's usually an
   introduction and you want that on the first page. For each other
   <sect> tag, include the id parameter and name it. Names should include
   only alphanumeric characters, and it should be short enough to
   understand what it is.
<sect1 id="tips">
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Using ldp.dsl

   The LDP uses its own DSSSL file, which adds things like a white
   background and automatic generation of the table of contents you see
   at the beginning of HOWTOs. You can find the latest copy of the file
   at [90]http://metalab.unc.edu/gferg/ldp/ldp.dsl.
   
   Once you have the file, you may need to do some editing of the first
   few lines based on the location of your DocBook DSSSL files. My
   example uses the Cygnus tool set.
   
   Place the ldp.dsl file in /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets and bring it up
   under your favorite text editor.You should see something like this:
   
<!DOCTYPE style-sheet PUBLIC "-//James Clark//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" [
<!ENTITY % html "IGNORE">
<![%html;[
<!ENTITY % print "IGNORE">
<!ENTITY docbook.dsl SYSTEM "docbook.dsl (1) " CDATA dsssl>
]]>
<!ENTITY % print "INCLUDE">
<![%print;[
<!ENTITY docbook.dsl SYSTEM "docbook.dsl (2) " CDATA dsssl>
]]>
]>

   [91](1) 
          Change the first "docbook.dsl" to read
          /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular/html/docbook.dsl
   [92](2) 
          Change the second "docbook.dsl" to read
          /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/nwalsh-modular/print/docbook.dsl
          
   If you're using another DSSSL, point those two files to the location
   of the HTML and print DSSSL files. They're usually in directories
   called html and print.
   
   With that complete, you can now generate HTML files:
bash$ mkdir HOWTO-HOWTO ; cd HOWTO-HOWTO
bash$ jade -t sgml -ihtml -d /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/ldp.dsl\#html ../HOWTO-H
OWTO.sgml

   The first command creates a new directory to put your files into. The
   second command (the jade one) generates individual HTML files for each
   section of your document. If you are going to something like RTF, you
   can do this:
bash$ jade -t rtf -d /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/ldp.dsl ../HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml
     _________________________________________________________________
   
CVS

   The LDP is in the process of providing CVS access to authors. There
   are a few good reasons for this:
   
    1. CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In the event
       that you hand over a document to another author, they can just
       retrieve the document from CVS and continue on. In the event you
       need to go back to a previous version of a document, you can
       retrieve it as well.
    2. It's great if you have many people working on the same document.
       You can have CVS tell you what changes were made while you were
       editing your copy by another author, and integrate those changes
       in.
    3. Keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and a date
       stamp) can be placed automatically inside the document when you
       use some special tags that get processed before the SGML
       processor.
    4. Can provide for a way for a program to automatically update the
       LDP web site with new documentation as it's written and submitted.
       This is not in place yet, but is a potential goal. Currently, CVS
       updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to update the LDP web page,
       meaning that if you use CVS, you're not required to e-mail your
       SGML code.
       
   If you're completely new to CVS, there are a few web pages you may
   want to look at which can help you out:
   
     * [93]http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS/Docs/blandy
     * [94]https://wroclaw.art.pl/~ser/docs/cvs.html
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Getting a CVS account

   First you'll need to get an account at the LDP's CVS Repository. This
   is pretty much the root directory that is used by CVS, with various
   projects (HOWTOs, mini HOWTOs, etc.) created as subdirectories of
   that.
   
   You will need to create a hashed password and userid for your account.
   The hashed password allows you to send an encrypted password to the
   CVS group without them needing to know your password. You can do this
   with the following command, from bash (or sh):
bash$ echo your_password | perl -e "print crypt(<>,\
join '',('.', '/', 0..9, 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z')[rand 64, rand 64]),\"\n\""

   Take the output of this command, and send it with your proposed userid
   to <[95]cvsadmin@cvslist.linuxdoc.org>. Your unique CVSROOT directory
   will be created and you'll get an e-mail with a response. When you get
   your response, log into your CVSROOT and make sure everything is set
   up properly:
bash$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:your_userid@cvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot
bash$ cvs -d $CVSROOT login

   (Replace the your_userid with what you were sent in the response
   e-mail).
   
   You will be asked for your password, and then given access to the CVS
   Repository in read-write mode. Once you've used cvs login once and
   have been given access to the system, your password is stored in
   .cvsroot and you will not have to use cvs login again. Just set the
   CVSROOT and continue on. You can get the entire linuxdoc repository
   with this command:
bash$ cvs get LDP

   Or you can get the SGML source for your own document with these
   commands:
bash$ cvs get howto/YOUR-HOWTO.sgml
bash$ cvs get minihowto/YOURDOC.sgml
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Other CVS repository notes

Anonymous CVS access

   Anonymous CVS access is available for those who do not require an
   account (such as those wishing to publish LDP documents). This
   repository is read-only:
bash$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@anoncvs.linuxdoc.org:/cvsroot login

   As a password, use cvs. You can then get linuxdoc modules as above.
   Note that changes to the anoncvs site may be a half an hour behind the
   main site.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
CVS Files via web

   You can access the CVS repository via the web at
   [96]http://cvsweb.linuxdoc.org/index.cgi/linuxdoc.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Graphical access to CVS

   There are graphical interfaces to CVS, and you can get a list of them
   at [97]http://freshmeat.net/appindex. Search for CVS.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Updating files and CVS

   CVS has a special tag, $Id, that you can use to automatically insert
   the date and version directly into the document. After committing, CVS
   will turn this tag into $Id: HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml,v 1.4 2000/06/12
   20:49:54 markk Exp $. By including this tag in your document, you can
   have that automatically change each time you change the file, allowing
   the revision mark to increment each time.
   
   When you're ready to upload changes to the CVS server, use the command
   cvs ci -m "comment" YOUR-HOWTO.sgml. The -m "comment" isn't necessary,
   but if you don't include it, you'll be brought into the editor
   (usually vi, or whatever your EDITOR environment variable is) and be
   given the chance to add a comment about the changes.
   
   You can follow more of the CVS discussion on the ldp-discuss list. For
   the time being, LDP submissions should still be sent to
   <[98]ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org>.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Distributing your documentation

Before you distribute

   Before you distribute your code to millions of potential readers there
   are a few things you should do.
   
   First, be sure to spell-check your document. Most utilities that you
   would use to write SGML have plug-ins to perform a spell check. If
   not, there's always the aspell program.
   
   Second, get someone to review your documentation for comments and
   factual correctness. The documentation that is published by the LDP
   needs to be as factually correct as possible, as there are millions of
   Linux users that may be reading it. If you're part of a larger mailing
   list talking about the subject, ask others from the list to help you
   out.
   
   Third, create a web site where you can distribute your documentation.
   This isn't required, but is helpful for people to find the original
   location of your document.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Validate your SGML code

   Using jade, or really the nsgmls command, you can validate your .sgml
   code against the DTD to make sure there aren't any errors.
bash$ nsgmls -s HOWTO-HOWTO.sgml

   If there are no issues, you'll just get your command prompt back.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Copyright and Licensing issues

   In order for an LDP document to be accepted by the LDP, it must be
   licensed to conform to the "LICENSE REQUIREMENTS" section of the LDP
   Manifesto located at [99]http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html. As an
   author, you may retain the copyright and add other restrictions (for
   example, you must approve any translations or derivative works). A
   sample license is available in the Manifesto or at
   [100]http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html. If you choose to use the
   boilerplate copyright, simply copy it into your source code under a
   section called "Copyright and Licenses" or similar. Also include a
   copyright statement of your own (since you still own it). If you are a
   new maintainer for an already-existing HOWTO, you must include the
   previous copyright statements of the previous author(s) and the dates
   they maintained that document.
   
   You'll note that the licensing for the HOWTO-HOWTO requires
   notification to the author of any derivative works or translations. I
   also explicitly place any source code (aside from the SGML the HOWTO
   was written in) under the GPL. If your HOWTO includes bits of source
   code that you want others to use, you may do the same.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Submission to LDP

   Once your LDP document has been carefully reviewed, you can release
   your document to the LDP. Send an e-mail with the SGML source code as
   an attachment(you may gzip it if you like) to
   <[101]ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org>.
   
   Be sure to include the name of your HOWTO in the subject line, and use
   the body to outline changes you've made and attach your HOWTO. This
   allows the maintainers to do their jobs faster, so you don't have to
   wait for your HOWTO to be updated on the LDP web site. If you don't
   hear anything in 7 calendar days, please follow up with an e-mail to
   make sure things are still in process.
   
   If your HOWTO contains extras, such as graphics or a special catalog,
   create a.tar.gz file with all the files in it including the .sgml
   source code and mail it as an attachment to the ldp-submit list.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
HOWTO maintenance

   Now that you're a HOWTO author, you should maintain the document and
   update it when new versions of software are released. You should also
   respond to reasonable comments and questions from your readers. You
   don't have to help them all, especially if their question is already
   answered in your HOWTO. However, a good experience with the LDP from
   readers is one of our goals and a great way of increasing the
   popularity of Linux
     _________________________________________________________________
   
FAQs about the LDP

I want to help the LDP. How can I do this?

   The easiest way is to find something and document it. Also check the
   unmaintained HOWTOs and see if there is a subject there that you know
   about and can continue documenting.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
I want to publish a collection of LDP documents in a book. How is the LDP
content licensed?

   Please see [102]http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html. Note that this
   is only a guideline to authors. However, the licensing cannot be more
   restrictive than what is listed in that URL.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
I found an error in an LDP document. Can I fix it?

   Contact the author of the document, or the LDP coordinator at
   <[103]ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org>and mention the problem and how
   you think it needs to be fixed.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
But I don't know SGML/Can't get the tools working/Don't like SGML

   That's okay. You have the option of writing your first draft of the
   HOWTO in the format of your choice, then submit that to the LDP. An
   LDP volunteer will review the document, then convert it into DocBook
   for you. Once that's done,it will be easier for you to maintain the
   HOWTO. If you run into questions,you can always drop a line to the LDP
   volunteer or the LDP Docbook list
   at<[104]ldp-docbook@lists.linuxdoc.org>.
