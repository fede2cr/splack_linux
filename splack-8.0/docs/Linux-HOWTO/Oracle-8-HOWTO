  $Revision: 1.14 $, $Date: 2000/06/19 21:07:43 $

  With this HOWTO, and a little luck, you will be able to get "Oracle 8i
  Enterprise Edition for Linux" installed, create a database and connect
  to it from a remote machine. The main focus of this guide is RedHat
  Linux 6.0, although it should work more-or-less unchanged for any
  other recent distribution.

  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  What's in here?

  Linux is well known for being difficult and, generally, user hostile.
  Being a bit of a Unix fan I'm not sure whether I agree with that or
  not.

  Oracle is similar I guess. Initially it's difficult to get to grips
  with, but it's difficult to work with any other RDBMS when you're used
  to it.

  Combine the two, remember that 8i is only the second production
  release, and you realise that this isn't going to be straight-forward,
  even if you're familiar with both.

  I am, but I had problems. Many problems were my own stupidity or
  hubris, but I document them for completeness.


  1.2.  Who is this HOWTO for?

  First, this document is for people who want to install Oracle 8i
  version 8.1.5 on Linux. It does not cover any earlier versions,
  although it should work with similar later versions such as 8.1.6.

  If you want to install 8.0, I recommend you try Linux Journals guide
  <http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue67/3572.html>, and if you
  want to install any of the previous versions you're going to have to
  use the SCO version and follow Paul Haigh's Oracle Database HOWTO
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Oracle-HOWTO.html>.

  If you're trying to install the 'right' version, what level of
  background knowledge will you need?

  Perhaps the easiest way is if I explain a little of my background,
  clearly if yours is similar we're going to be on the same wave-length.
  I've used a lot of Unix and Oracle over the last few years. At home
  I've been running Linux since 1994 and I've been using Solaris and HP-
  UX on-and-off since 1992. I first came across Oracle in 1996 and have
  worked with both versions 7 and 8. I'm mainly a developer, but I have
  done DBA and sysadmin-type work.

  In summary, I can find my way around a Unix box and I know much of the
  Oracle terminology. You'll need both to brave the rest of this
  document. But don't worry if you have a different background, follow
  this guide closely and keep asking questions. The Linux community are
  a helpful bunch, just don't expect an answer if you haven't at least
  made an effort to solve the problem yourself.


  1.3.  New versions of this document

  Things move quickly in the world of Linux and Oracle, meaning that
  this document can quickly get out of date. If this document is more

  2.  Starting off

  2.1.  Overview

  In this section, we'll set up Linux so that you're in a position to
  get Oracle 8i from the CD that they sent you into your hard-disk.

  The Oracle installation process begins when you've built your PC,
  installed Linux, configured it and connected it to your network.


  2.2.  Prerequisites

  2.2.1.  Hardware

  I think that the most important part of the prerequisites is not to
  underestimate them. Oracle is a very big and complex application and
  you won't get the best out of it if you skimp too much on the
  hardware.

  My biggest mistake was to assume that Oracle were joking when they
  said that you need 128Mb of RAM. I've installed Oracle a couple of
  times on Sun servers with that much, why would I need more on a CISC
  machine?

  Believe Oracle not my gut. My machine with 32Mb of Ram ground on for
  less than half an hour before I realised that it was hopeless.

  I was trying to use the bare minimum of hardware, and that's generally
  a bad idea. If you can't afford the hardware you certainly won't be
  able to afford the licences!

  Things to look for on a production server are many disks, possibly
  RAIDed, and fast CPU's. Database access is relatively easy to break
  down into smaller parallel phases so having a number of processors
  really does help.

  On the other hand, any machine that can run Linux and that has enough
  memory should be in with a chance. My other machine, the one I used
  for the rest of this document, is fine as a development machine. It is
  a Celeron 466Mhz with 128Mb of memory, an 8Gb hard disk, an Intel
  graphics card and a DM9102 network card.


  2.3.  Linux setup

  2.3.1.  Choice of distribution

  Oracle seem to have done most of their development on RedHat Linux
  6.0. For a fuss-free installation, do the same. I've heard horror
  stories about trying to get it installed on other distributions.

  However, anything like RedHat should also do the trick. A recent
  version of Mandrake or SuSE should be fine (SuSE, in fact, are fairly
  active in supporting Oracle), and newer versions of RH pose no
  problems either.


  2.3.2.  Distribution Setup

  Now that you've decided on which RedHat-like distribution you're going
  to use, you'll need to work out which options to set and which of the
  vast number of packages need to be installed to make Oracle work.

  Firstly you need two to three times the amount of memory you have for
  your swap space. (You'll need around 200Mb of memory, real or virtual,
  just to run the installer!) Note that contrary to popular opinion,
  Linux swap partitions can be larger than 128Mb.

  The arrangements of your other partitions can also be important. Make
  sure that the Oracle software is on a different partition to your
  operating system, and make sure that the Oracle datafiles are on yet
  another partition.  The idea here is to make sure that your datafiles
  do not get fragmented. (In a live environment, you're likely to have a
  number of disk with Oracle spread across them. There are a number of
  good books that you consult for more information on this.)

  As for the software, I took the easy option and installed just about
  everything. You certainly need all the 'base' packages, X Windows (the
  installation routine is a Java GUI) and the development tools
  regardless of whether you intend doing any coding or not. Compared to
  the size of Oracle and your databases a Linux distribution is tiny,
  probably less than a gigabyte. It's worth installing it all for an
  easy life!


  2.3.3.  Kernel parameters

  The documentation suggests that you make changes to the Linux kernel
  so you can get more shared memory. Since this is so difficult in Linux
  (unlike most commercial Unix's you have to recompile the kernel), the
  approach I took was to go ahead with the installation anyway. The
  default RedHat Linux settings worked, although you may have to change
  them for a larger development or production system.

  Note that some people have had to recompile the kernel to get Oracle
  to work at all. I guess it must depend on the other software that
  you're running on the same machine.

  Follow the instructions in the Oracle documentation (on the
  installation CD in HTML format) and the Linux Kernel HOWTO
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html> to build your new
  kernel.


  2.3.4.  Users and groups

  Using LinuxConf (or whatever other method you feel comfortable with),
  you need to add a new group called "dba" and a new user called
  "oracle", which should belong to your newly created "dba" group.

  You can make any other user a DBA by putting them in the DBA group. If
  you have several DBA's this is probably a good idea for auditing
  purposes.


  2.3.5.  Installing the right Java Virtual Machine

  If you check the official documentation, you'll find that Oracle
  recommend the Blackdown Java Runtime Environment version 1.1.6v5.
  That's what they mean. Don't think 'newer versions will be less buggy'
  as the installer probably won't work. And don't think, 'I'll be
  developing software so I'll just get the JDK,' as that won't work
  either.

  There is one caveat to using this version of the JRE: the Oracle
  installer seems to be hard-coded to expect the JRE executable to be at
  /usr/local/jre/bin/jre. While this is inconvenient, it does not mean
  that you have to install it there.

  I performed the following steps to get a working copy of the JRE:


  1. Download the Java Runtime Environment from the Blackdown website
     <http://www.blackdown.org>

  2. Move to where you want to install the JRE:


     cd /usr/local



  3. Uncompress the archive:


     bzip2 -d -c jre-1.1.6-v5-glibc-x86.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -



  4. Create a symbolic link between where Oracle thinks it is and where
     it actually is:
     ln -s jre116_v5 jre



  2.4.  Starting off questions and answers

  2.4.1.  Do I really need 128Mb RAM?

  I would recommend that you do use 128Mb of RAM or more. I think it
  would be difficult to get any serious work done with less.

  However, if you disable the Java option and set all the shared memory
  settings to be relatively small, there's no reason why it shouldn't
  work. I've heard success stories with 64Mb. You're probably not going
  to get away with 32Mb, though.

  There is a caveat. You may only need half of what Oracle recommends to
  run the thing, but to install it their number starts to make sense.
  I've heard reports of the installer using 150Mb of memory and I've
  seen it well over 120Mb myself. If you have 64Mb or less of memory,
  make sure you have lots of swap space and patience.

  An alternative if you absolutely can't add more memory: install Oracle
  on another, bigger machine and copy across the $ORACLE_HOME directory.
  You'll need to make sure that you have all the same users and groups
  (preferably with the same numeric codes) and take special care with
  SUID executables like $ORACLE_HOME/bin/oracle/.


  2.4.2.  Does it work with RedHat 6.1 or above?

  I'm still running 6.0 myself, so all I can say is that a number of
  people have claimed success with this configuration.

  At the time of writing, Oracle 8i has been certified with RedHat 6.0
  and "Certification for other distributions is currently in progress"
  (Oracle 8i Patch FAQ).


  2.4.3.  Does it work with Debian/SuSE/Mandrake/some other distribu­
  tion?

  Oracle specify the Linux kernel version 2.2 or above and GLIBC version
  2.1 with any window manager. In theory, any distribution that meets
  these requirements should work.

  In practice, Oracle may not support it and you may have more problems
  trying to complete the installation. Unless you have a very good
  reason to do otherwise I suggest you stick to RedHat 6.0 with all the
  patches you can get hold of.


  2.4.4.  Does it work with development kernels?

  There's no obvious reason why it shouldn't work -- I used 2.3.19 for a
  while because it supported my network card and the stable kernel at
  the time didn't -- but unless there's a pressing need it's certainly
  safest to stay well clear. I switched back to the stable series as
  soon as the driver was included.


  2.4.5.  Where do I get Oracle from?

  Firstly, if you're brave, have a very fast Internet connection or
  inexhaustible patience (and unmetered access) you can download it from
  Oracle Technet <http://technet.oracle.com/>. Beware: it's nearly
  200Mb, and 8.1.6 is even bigger.

  A better option is to get the CD. Oracle sometimes offer to send you a
  free development CD when you join Technet. It's certainly worth
  spending some time looking round their web site for that.
  Alternatively, you can buy them from the Oracle Store for around $40.
  It includes lots of other software too and comes on 15 discs.


  3.  The installer

  3.1.  How?

  Generally, following the documentation is a good idea. It's not that
  bad and you'll get much better support from Oracle if you have. (I
  ended up breaking things -- and knowing it would -- by following the
  documentation for Oracle Applications. It was the only way to get
  decent support.)

  This document is going to give an overview, but you should still have
  their documentation available.


  3.2.  What do I tell the installation program?

  As part of the installation Oracle will ask a number of questions.
  Generally they're not too difficult but let's see what I entered and
  why.


  1. Many people make the mistake of following Oracle's documentation
     and, therefore, fail at the first hurdle. Don't execute
     runInstaller as it almost always fails. Instead move to
     install/linux on the CD and run runIns.sh while logged in as
     'oracle'.

  2. It should show a title screen. Click 'Next.'

  3. It should ask you to enter the source directory of the installation
     files ('jar' file) and your Oracle installation directory. You
     should be able to leave the former alone. The Oracle home directory
     is where you want to install the software. According to the
     installation documentation is should be somewhere on /u01, but I
     ignored that and put it in /home/oracle. Oracles advice, in this
     respect, is usually worth following. Click 'Next' when you've
     entered the details.

  4. Now it should ask you for the DBA group. This is the Unix group you
     created in the last section and is probably 'dba'. Enter the
     details and click 'Next.'

  5. This time it wants you to log in as 'root' and run
     /tmp/OraInstall/orainstRoot.sh. Do as it says. (You may have to run
     pdksh or bash in the 'Bourne compatibility mode' to get it to
     complete successfully.) When you're done click 'Retry.'

  6. You're now given the option of what to install. Your best bet here
     is 'Oracle Enterprise Edition,' as this includes just about
     everything (table 3.1 in the Oracle documentation tells you exactly
     what it installs).  Make sure the right radio button is selected
     and click 'Next.'

  7. It should now allow you to choose what you install with much finer
     granularity. Unless you're particularly constrained by disk space
     or know exactly what you need, I'd recommend leaving it exactly as
     it is and clicking 'Next.' The Universal Installer won't let you
     make any silly choices so don't worry too much if you unselect
     something. You can always add it back in later.

  8. For any products that you've asked it to install, the installer
     will allow you to change where it puts them. Again, only if you
     have a good reason to should you change it. Click 'Next' when
     you're done.

  9. It now goes away and installs all the pieces of software you asked
     it to. This will probably take quite a while and will use far more
     memory than is reasonable.

  10.
     It should ask you if you want to create a database. Select when it
     does, it's very slow (it seems to fire up another JVM, leaving X,
     the Oracle back-end and two virtual machines in memory; not good
     with 128Mb of memory).

  11.
     The installer should now ask you about the network protocols that
     you want Oracle to support. The boxes all came up blank for me. I
     don't know what's supposed to be in there, but I clicked 'Next' and
     found that everything worked.

  12.
     All the hard stuff is complete now. All the products you want
     should be installed and are ready to go. Congratulations.


  3.3.  Installing the patch

  Unfortunately, the CD that Oracle sent you was probably version
  8.1.5.0.0. As with almost all first releases there are problems with
  that version (problems include empty files, so they're quite serious)
  and a patch, to version 8.1.5.0.2 is essential. You'll certainly need
  it to progress to the "Configuration" section of this HOWTO. The patch
  described here is a cumulative patch, i.e., it includes all the files
  required to move from version 8.1.5.0.0 to 8.1.5.0.2.

  The file you need is on the Oracle web site
  <http://technet.oracle.com/software/products/oracle8i/software_index.htm>
  and is relatively easy to install.


  1. This is probably the first of many patches, so create a directory
     called "patches" somewhere convenient (mine is in $ORACLE_HOME).

  2. Download the file into it.

  3. Create somewhere to put the files:

     mkdir /tmp/orapatch
     cd /tmp/orapatch



  4. Uncompress the file:

     tar zvxf $ORACLE_HOME/patches/linux815patches.tgz



  5. Run the shell script that's now in the current directory:


     ./linux_815patches.sh



  Note that it's important not to uncompress the file in the current
  directory. The patch installer checks that the correct number of files
  are present and fails if there are not the right number. Of course, if
  it finds the patch archive it finds too many files!


  3.4.  Setting up your environment

  Add the following lines to your ".profile" (or whatever the equivalent
  is for your shell):


  . oraenv
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib



  Quite why the Oracle installer doesn't do this I have no idea.

  If you see "[: integer expression expected before -lt" the next time
  you log in, it's because 'oraenv' is expecting your ULIMIT to be an
  integer rather than the default 'unlimited.' I've seen no ill effects
  by ignoring the error, but you can fix it by setting the ULIMIT to
  something finite.


  3.5.  Installations questions and answers

  3.5.1.  The installation program exits with 'CreateOUIProcess()'

  Firstly, make sure that you're running the right version of the JVM. I
  don't know what Oracle do with their software, but it's very dependent
  on the version you use.

  Secondly, it might help if, instead of running runInstaller from the
  root of the CD, you move into install/linux and run the runInst.sh
  shell script instead.

  This problem seems more common on RedHat 6.1 than 6.0 and could be
  something to do with a newer C library.

  I've also heard reports that if you have the wrong version of Gnome's
  usual window manager, Enlightenment, you might get this problem.
  Upgrade or switch to another environment such as KDE or Fvwm2.


  3.5.2.  The installer just flashes on the screen and then vanishes

  This is not an uncommon occurrence. Usually it means that you're
  running an old version of Enlightenment. Upgrading or switching to
  another environment should fix the problem.

  A similar problem is the installation program vanishing at some later
  point in the process, often around 80% of the way through. The
  consensus seems to be that Oracle ran out of memory. You should
  increase the amount of swap space your machine has, anything over
  200Mb should be sufficient.



  3.5.3.  Strange Java errors when I start the installation program?

  Which version of the Java Virtual Machine are you using? People have
  claimed success with other versions, but most of the problems that I
  had disappeared when I downgraded to JRE 1.1.6v5, the one that Oracle
  recommends in their documentation.

  Two other things that are worth mentioning: make sure you use the JRE
  and not the JDK and, secondly, you should be using "green" threads.
  Unless you've set THREADS_FLAG to 'native' you almost certainly have
  the correct setting.


  3.5.4.  The installation program 'Segmentation Fault's

  You do have GLIBC 2.1 don't you?


  3.5.5.  Problems loading shared libraries

  The error message that I'm talking about looks a bit like this:


  error in loading shared libraries: libclntsh.so.8.0: cannot open
  shared object file: No such file or directory



  This is the same as NT complaining that it can't find a DLL. It's very
  easy to fix. Simply add the following line to the end of your
  ".profile" if you're using a Bourne-like shell (ask a local guru if
  you don't know):


  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib



  Or use the following line if you're using a CSH-like shell:


  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ORACLE_HOME/lib"



  I don't use the C-Shell, so independent verification of this command
  would be appreciated.


  3.5.6.  Pro*C doesn't work

  The answer to this took quite a bit of tracking down, although the
  answer is on the Oracle web site if you look hard enough.

  The default configuration of Pro*C doesn't know where to find all its
  libraries, so you need to tell it. After installation
  $ORACLE_HOME/precomp/admin/pcscfg.cfg is empty, but it needs to
  contain the following:



  sys_include=(/home/oracle/precomp/public, /usr/include,
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include/,
  /usr/include, /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include,
  /usr/include)
  include=(/home/oracle/precomp/public)
  include=(/home/oracle/rdbms/demo)
  include=(/home/oracle/network/public)
  include=(/home/oracle/plsql/public)
  ltype=short



  (The first four lines above, from sys_include to include) should all
  be on the same line in the file.)

  The Oracle documentation doesn't mention this, but you also need to
  edit $ORACLE_HOME/precomp/lib/env_precomp.mk. On the line that defines
  CCPSYSINCLUDE, put the following:


  CCPSYSINCLUDE=sys_include='($(ORACLE_HOME)/precomp/public,
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include,
  /usr/include/g++-2, /usr/include)'



  This works for RedHat 6.0, but may need tweaking for other
  distributions or later versions of RH.


  3.5.7.  I installed the patch but it made things worse!

  This is tricky, barely documented by Oracle and common across all
  their products and installation programs. It's about time they did
  something about it!

  Often what happens is as follows: you install Oracle Enterprise
  Edition and, as Oracle tells you, you dash off and install all the
  available patches. Then you decide you need the pre-compilers and
  install Oracle Programmer from the same CD.

  Before you installed Pro*C your database worked, and now it doesn't.

  The problem is that the versions of the pre-compilers that you
  installed were not patched and some of the Oracle server code relies
  on the fixes; Oracle's installer is so stupid that it will overwrite
  newer version of the same code.

  The solution is not pretty. Since you can't extract an individual file
  from the CD you need to install the whole thing again, this time
  adding Oracle Programmer before the patch.


  3.5.8.  Oracle thinks I don't have enough disk space

  There's something wrong with the installation program. Assuming you do
  have enough space it will install okay.


  4.  Creating a database

  4.1.  Overview

  Hopefully you followed the advice from the previous section and didn't
  create a database.

  For most people, I can probably outline the process in a couple of
  words: "Run 'dbassist'." Unless this is the first time you've ever run
  Oracle, none of the questions should really phase you.

  For completeness, I'll document what I did but I'd best say what I was
  aiming for first. Bottom line: this is neither a production system nor
  a 'serious' (i.e., several people, full time) development box. I
  installed 8i to play around and see what was new or different from 8
  and older versions.

  This means that when 'dbassist' offered an easy option I took it. And
  when it suggested using a different disk, or at least a different
  partition, I declined. My $ORACLE_HOME is /home/oracle. All the data
  files and software are in there, all on one partition.


  4.2.  Step-by-step guide


  1. Bring up a command prompt and type:

     dbassist



  2. My machine tells me that "JNLS Exception:
     oracle.ntpg.jnls.JNLSException. Unable to find any National
     Character Sets." According to Oracles 8i Patch FAQ, this is a known
     problem (884001) and can safely be ignored.

  3. Select the "Create a database" radio button and press "Next"

  4. There are two options: Typical and Custom. If you knew exactly what
     you were doing you probably wouldn't be reading this and could
     comfortably select Custom. I'm not going to cover that. Instead
     I'll assume you select "Typical" and press "Next"

  5. Next it asks whether you want to copy the database from your CD or
     to create the data files. Whenever I tried the first option, Oracle
     couldn't find my CD player (you just installed from it!). So I
     recommend choosing the second option. It's not difficult, it
     probably just takes longer

  6. It's probably safe to select 'Hybrid' when it asks you what
     environment the database will operate in

  7. Now it asks you how many users will be using your database at any
     given time. I put five.

  8. Next it asks you what products you want to install in your new
     database. Again, you know what you want better than me!

  9. Oracle needs a "Global Database Name" and a "SID" now. The database
     name is like a fully qualified domain name (but different). If
     you're the Oracle guru you'll know what to put, if not your
     organisation might have some conventions. I called mine 'dev1'
     (both the SID and database name).

  10.
     Now, do you want to create the database 'now' or should you let it
     save the information to a shell script? With 128Mb of RAM I found
     the former option painful.

     I created the shell script, quit out of X and anything else using a
     lot of memory and then ran the script. Much more snappy.

  11.
     I didn't notice this in any of the documentation, but your database
     won't work properly without it! The database that 'dbassist'
     creates is fine, but by default the user rollback segments are left
     off-line. (Read: non-system users can't perform any operation that
     requires transactions.)

     Type:

     cd $ORACLE_HOME/dbs



  You now need to edit a file called "init<SID>.ora" ("initdev1.ora" in
  my case).

  About half-way down the file is a commented out line looking something
  like this:


  # rollback_segments = (r01, r02, r03, r04)



  Uncomment this line (remove the hash), save the file and you're done.

  12.
     This is a kind of meta-step. You have a database and you should be
     able to start it up, but you probably don't know what any of the
     system passwords are!

     There are two that you need to know. The first is the SYSTEM
     password. This defaults to 'MANAGER'. (It seems to be conventional
     to put Oracle passwords in uppercase. In fact passwords are not
     case sensitive.) I recommend you change it straight away by typing
     password at the SQL*Plus prompt. (For people expecting an ALTER
     USER command, this is new to the version of SQL*Plus supplied with
     8i.)

     The other password that you need to know is the one for SYS. It
     defaults to 'CHANGE_ON_INSTALL' and you should do exactly what it
     says!

  13.
     Final step. This one gets rid of the annoying 'no profile' warnings
     you get when you log into SQL*Plus.

     Log into SQL*Plus as user 'system' (sqlplus system/<password>).
     Then type:


     @?/sqlplus/admin/pupbld.sql



  The question-mark is an alias for the $ORACLE_HOME directory.

  14.
     This is an optional step used to define the default editor for
     SQL*Plus (it defaults to ed so you do!). Open
     $ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql in your favourite editor and
     add define_editor=<editor name> to the end.

  And that's it. You should now have an operational database that you
  can log into using SQL*Plus.

  4.3.  Questions and answers

  4.3.1.  Is it really that easy?

  Yes and no. If you're just playing around, building a database for
  yourself to learn the new features of 8i, then 'yes.' The database the
  above instructions will build is complete and will work fine.

  However, if you know anything about Oracle, you will quickly realise
  that the default configuration is appallingly bad. If you're making a
  serious, production system I recommend you use the "Custom" option.

  Even for my toy system I did some tweaking. I increased the sizes of
  most of the table-spaces and changed them so that they didn't grow
  automatically (I hate software when it tries to be too clever).


  4.3.2.  Is it really necessary to put all the files on different
  disks?

  No and it will work fine if you don't, but I don't recommend putting
  all your files on the same disk nevertheless.

  Spreading the files over a number of disks, even it's just the data
  files on one and the rollback segments on another, will have a
  significant performance advantage. Read an Oracle DBA book if you need
  further information.


  4.3.3.  I can't start dbassist

  Caused by several zero-length files in the initial installation.
  Following the patch procedure will fix this problem.


  4.3.4.  I get "ORA-01034: ORACLE not available"

  To cut a long story short, your $ORACLE_SID is probably set
  incorrectly or not at all. Make sure it's set to the same value you
  gave 'dbassist' and that it's value is exported (i.e., export
  ORACLE_SID in any Bourne compatible shell).


  4.3.5.  I get "ORA-01012: Not logged in"

  This is a very common error, and there are a number of different
  things that cause it.

  Firstly you'll want to make sure that you're not creating a Shared
  Server configuration (sometimes known as MTS). Create a database using
  Dedicated Server and convert it later.

  If that's not it, check your NLS_LANG environment variable. The
  easiest option is to unset it. If you really want to use it, make sure
  that you have it exactly right. Make sure you don't transpose any '1's
  (one's) for 'l's (the twelfth letter of the alphabet)!


  4.3.6.  Can datafiles only be 1Gb in size?

  this to be a bug as Linux has no problem with files up to 2Gb.



  5.  Configuration

  5.1.  Overview

  Congratulations, you have Oracle running on your Linux box. You have
  created a database and can connect to it using SQL*Plus.

  Of course, this is not the end of it. Ideally, you'd be able to
  connect to it as another Unix user or from a completely different
  machine. That is what this section is for.


  5.2.  Connecting as another user

  Some of the details in this section are a little sketchy as this is
  not a configuration that I personally use. However, performing one of
  the following steps should work:


  ·

     . oraenv


  or pdksh)

  ·

     source coraenv



  When running "oraenv" I get an error if I use 'bash', the default
  Linux shell. It seems not to cause any problems so don't worry. You
  can always use 'pdksh' if it does worry you.


  5.3.  Connecting from another machine

  I remember this being very complex with earlier versions of Oracle,
  but just seemed to work here. I'm sure that must mean that I did
  something wrong, forgot something I did or that there's a massive
  security hole.

  This is what I remember doing:


  1. Logging into Linux as user 'oracle'

  2. Make sure that "oraenv" has been executed (i.e., your $ORACLE_HOME
     is set correctly)

  3. Type:

     lsnrctl start



  On your client machine all you need to do now is point it at the right
  machine and database instance.

  If you want more control over the process, the "Net8 Configuration
  Assistant" ('netec') should be able to help.



  5.4.  Connecting to another machine

  This used to be very difficult in many earlier version of Oracle,
  involving editing many text files, most of which had an fantastically
  complex syntax.

  But in 8i, if you've got your JVM working, then all you need is the
  "Net8 Easy Config" program. Follow these steps to allow your machine
  to connect to a database on another machine:


  1. Start "Net8 Easy Config" by typing netec at the command prompt
     while logged in as 'oracle.'

  2. After a short delay while Java gets its act together, the welcome
     screen appears. It should be asking what you want to do. Leave the
     radio buttons on the left alone (the default is 'create') and enter
     the name of the database in the text box. Click 'Next' when you're
     done.

  3. Select one of the protocols it offers. Unless you know differently,
     this should probably be 'TCP/IP' which is the default. Press
     'Next.'

  4. Enter the hostname (or IP address) of the remote machine. The port
     number probably doesn't need changing. Press 'Next.'

  5. Select the type of database (8i or other) using the radio buttons
     and enter the name in the appropriate text box. Press 'Next.'

  6. You can now test that the information you've enter makes sense to
     Oracle. I found that 'netec' has a tendency to crash if some of the
     details are wrong. Press 'Next' when you're sure that it all works.
     You can keep pressing the 'Back' button to go back and correct any
     information.

  7. If you're happy with all the information you've entered, you can
     press the 'Finish' button and that's it!

  If you want more control over the process, you may need to use the
  "Net8 Assistant" -- a big window with many confusing options -- which
  can be started with the netasst command.


  5.5.  Questions and answers

  5.5.1.  I can't start 'netasst'

  The problem is with a couple of zero-length files. Installing the
  patch should fix this problem.


  6.  Final Words

  6.1.  Useful Software

  Now that you've managed to get Oracle installed, you'll want to try
  and use it. Although it's possible to do everything from your server
  PC, it's generally best to user the client-server facilities and use
  another machine to access your database.

  Naturally Oracle have a large collection of, largely, pretty good
  client software, however there's not much for Linux at this time. Of
  the Oracle software, I recommend getting hold of the following:


  ·  Oracle Enterprise Manager. It's much easier not to have to remember
     all those obscure ALTER USER and ALTER SYSTEM commands.

  ·  Oracle WebDB. It can be quite difficult to install, but it can
     allow people to build impressive web-sites without knowing any
     HTML.

  But most of the best software comes from other places...


  ·  Tool for Oracle Application Development (T.O.A.D.). This used to be
     free but is now owned by Quest Software <http://www.quest.com>. You
     can download a free version (if you're prepared to do it every
     couple of months) or you can pay for it. It's significantly more
     expensive than free but is not bad value.

  ·  SQLNavigator. Also by Quest Software <http://www.quest.com>. I've
     not really used it but it's been highly recommended by all who
     have.

  ·  Orac <http://www.kkitts.com/orac-dba/>. Another that I've not used
     much, but has been described as a nice, configurable DBA-tool by a
     number of people.


  6.2.  Useful Books

  I seem to get most of my Oracle information from colleagues and books.
  I'm not able to give away my colleagues, but the books I recommend are
  as follows:


  ·

     "Oracle Performance Tuning," Mark Gurry and Peter Corrigan,
     O'Reilly and Associates, ISBN 1-56592-237-9.

  ·

     "Oracle Design," Dave Ensor and Ian Stevenson, O'Reilly and
     Associates, ISBN 1-56592-268-9.

  ·

     "PL/SQL Programming," Steven Feuerstein, O'Reilly and Associates,
     ISBN 1-56592-335-9.

  ·

     "PL/SQL Built-in Packages," Steven Feuerstein, O'Reilly and
     Associates, ISBN 1-56592-375-8.

  You'll note a bit of an O'Reilly <http://www.ora.com> theme there.
  I've not found a bad O'Reilly book yet. Similarly, I've never found a
  good Oracle Press book.


  6.3.  Useful Internet resources

  There's a lot of useful stuff on the web.


  ·  Oracle Technet <http://technet.oracle.com>. This is Oracle's public
     and free support website. Lot's of very useful information there.


  ·  Oracle Metalink <http://support.oracle.com>. Oracle's private (you
     need a support contract) support website. Only slightly more useful
     than Technet!

  ·  Oracle Fans <http://www.orafans.com>. Editorials and support
     forums. No official connection to Oracle (so the information there
     is less biased!).

  ·  OraFaq <http://www.orafaq.org>. A site full of questions and
     answers regarding Oracle on all platforms.

  ·  Oracle Linux mailing list (Send a mail to ListGuru@fatcity.com
     <mailto:ListGuru@fatcity.com> with the words 'SUBSCRIBE ORACLE-
     LINUX-L' in the body.

  ·  And don't forget my website <http://www.zx81.org.uk>!
