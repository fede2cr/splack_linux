1. Introduction

   The traditional means of troubleshooting computer-related problems
   involves consulting user's manuals, books, friends - probably enticed
   with goodies - and, when all the former do not yield a solution,
   calling the technical support service of the vendor of the product in
   question. And, we all know pleasant and reliably efficacious the
   latter stratagem is. Unfortunately, this is the norm in the sphere of
   commercial proprietary products.
   
   In contradistinction, Linux, and related distributions, utilities and
   applications software, has largely been developed according to the
   [26]Open Source model, wherein developers have used electronic
   communication over the Internet - typically in the form of
   publically-accessible Mailing Lists- to collaborate with their peers
   in the refinement of the associated source code. Such collaboration
   has also traditionally involved the online publication of user's
   manuals, lists of Frequently-Asked-Questions ( FAQ's ) , knowledge
   bases, release notes, formal guides such as this document (HOWTO's)
   and tutorials. In addition, users often assist others through the
   forum of Usenet and other newsgroups and the posted messages are
   readily accessible in the form of searchable archives. These
   linux-related newsgroups are renowned for their high level of user
   participation. In significant measure, Linux may be considered a
   product of the Internet.
   
   Considered together, these resources enable access to a large,
   ever-expanding factual database, and my intent is to encourage and
   direct the reader to utilize these repositories when faced with an
   issue not addressed in the documentation that is included with each
   distribution of Linux. Linux veterans who assist newcomers through the
   forum of Usenet soon become aware of the frequency with which certain
   technical questions are repeatedly posted - questions the answers to
   which are readily available in one or more of the existent online
   repositories. So, to diminish the likelihood of being "flamed" in
   response to your posted question on Usenet or irc , read further!
   
   Armed with a browser, Linux users may rapidly become adept at
   troubleshooting their systems. The key is knowing how and where to
   look. My objective is to guide the user - particularly the Linux
   newbie - in this quest.

2. Document Updates

   The latest version of this document will always be available via the
   Documents Catalog at the [27]Open Source Writers Group The document
   will also be available in SGML, PS, RTF, DVI and other formats at that
   website.

2.2. Feedback and Corrections

   I always welcome feedback and constructive criticism.In particular, I
   wish to be notified about any errors in this document and resources
   you believe deserving of inclusion, but not presently covered herein.
   Because the assessment of the value of a particular resource is
   inherently subjective, I do not guarantee that I will include it, but
   I will certainly give any suggestion thoughtful consideration. In
   anticipation, Thanks.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3. HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs

   These documents are associated with the [29]Linux Documentation
   Project. There is a [30]HOWTO Index Page that I suggest you bookmark
   in your browser.
   
   These HOWTOs are written by Linux users and are periodically updated
   by the authors. Many authors provide the latest version at a personal
   website and a hyperlink to the latter is typically provided in the
   document.This version may be newer than that available at the website.
   The document may be published online before its inclusion into the
   database.
   
   Note also that other HOWTOs are available, the authors of which have
   not submitted them to the LDP. It is definitely worthwhile trying to
   find these using an Internet search engine as I describe in a
   subsequent section.
   
   These documents are particularly useful when you decide to provide or
   access a new service with your Linux system, or when you embark on a
   technically complex project. For example, you may have the option of
   accessing the 'net with a DSL or Cable Modem service - excellent
   guides are available in the form of HOWTOs.
   
   In addition, authors often include references and links to sites that
   they have found useful. You may find the information you need at one
   of these hyperlinked sites rather than in the HOWTO itself. For
   example, I found [31]Linux Network Drivers, the primary site for
   information about Network Interface Card drivers , in the Ethernet
   HOWTO.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4. Frequently-Asked-Questions ( FAQs)

   A list of FAQs is a traditional accompaniment to Linux-related
   applications, utilities, and the like. An FAQ is typically provided
   online by the developer/s of the product in question, and enterprising
   users sometimes host an "unofficial" FAQ as well. Search for the
   latter with an Internet search engine.
   
   The FAQ is the first document to peruse when troubleshooting a
   particular application. In addition, FAQs exist for Linux
   distributions, window managers, and the so-called desktop environments
   ( KDE and Gnome ).
   
   For Linux newbies, I provide links to three FAQs that collectively
   address many of the questions posted to the Usenet newsgroups :
   
     * [32]The Linux FAQ
     * [33]The XFree86 X - Window System FAQ
     * [34]The Linux Kernel mailing list FAQ
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5. Online Support Sections

   These sections are typically found at the websites of Linux
   distributions, and often contain a variety of helpful documents with
   information not easily encompassed within a FAQ. Look for sections
   with one or more of the following titles:
   
     * Installation Support
     * Knowledge or Solutions Databases
     * Tips and Tricks
     * Errata, Fixes and Updates
     * White Papers
     * Technical Guides
     * Hardware Guide or Compatibility List
     * Security Information
       
   Some websites provide a site search engine that will facilitate your
   quest for a solution.
   
   If you have a problem with a newly installed distribution, look here
   first as bugs and their fixes are typically posted here. You may find
   a detailed guide that will help you accomplish a task such as
   upgrading your kernel or the version of the XFree86 X - Window System
   you are using.
   
   I recommend you spend some time at the website of the distribution you
   are using, familiarizing yourself with what is available.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6. Usenet Newsgroup Archives

   The ability to search for and retrieve information from archived posts
   to the linux-related (Usenet) newsgroups represents a powerful means
   of troubleshooting in Linux.
   
   Search engines permit one to search the archives by stipulating the
   forum, keywords, authors, dates, language and combinations thereof.
   Because the number of linux-related newsgroups is large, the
   likelihood of finding useful information is high.
   
   I would like to relate a brief anecdote to demonstrate the efficacy of
   this approach. The first time I attempted to build a kernel, I was
   presented with this error message when I invoked a "make" command:
make[1]: as86: Command not found make[1]: *** [bootsect.o] Error 127
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot' make: *** [zImage]
Error 2

   I had no idea what as86 was, but I entered it as the keyword in the
   SUBJECT field of the Power Search utility at deja.com ( see below) ,
   and was presented with a large number of posts from folks who had
   encountered the same problem. Respondents had provided the reason and
   solution: I did not have an assembler/linker necessary to create
   machine code, and the bin86 package provided it. I downloaded and
   installed a RPM package of the latter and was on my way. This entire
   process took about 10 minutes ( I do have an ADSL connection to the
   'net ! ).
   
   There are two websites that provide access to Usenet archives using a
   search engine as described in the following sections.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.1. Power Search at deja.com

   The [35]Power Search page allows you to search using keywords and
   other parameters.I suggest you spend some time becoming familiar with
   the [36]Search Language nuances. In particular, note the value of
   using the wildcard symbol. You will be repaid time and again for your
   efforts. I typically enter the following for a "routine" search:
   
   LANGUAGE : English
   
   SUBJECT : try different keywords, thinking of a subject line you would
   use for a post
   
   FORUM : *linux* or comp.os.linux.*
   
   Another version of this search engine is this [37]Customized Power
   Search Page. Customize this page to your liking ( I like the "
   DejaClassic" option ), and then choose " Save Settings."
   
   The [38]DejaSearch utility is another application that you may use. It
   will print out the retrieved posts in one HTML file for your perusal.
   By using this, you will not have to page back and forth in your
   browser.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.2. Searchlinux.com (CNET Linux Help)

   The [39]Searchlinux website is relatively new, with many of the same
   features as deja.com. It has "basic" and "advanced" search options.
   The latter does not have as many options as the Power Search feature
   at deja.com. It has a nice one-click option whereby one may view one's
   own posts and associated replies
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7. Internet Search Engines

   I frequently use a Search Engine to retrieve helpful or necessary
   information from the 'net. These engines catalogue pages from
   commercial, personal and academic websites, as well as Mailing Lists
   and the like.
   
   Of course, there are a large number of available Search Engines, and I
   suggest you try several before giving up on a particular quest.
   Research has shown that any one of them catalogues but a small portion
   of existent web pages. It is worthwhile becoming very familiar with
   the operational details of at least one non-directory engine to
   maximize the efficiency and efficacy of your search efforts. You
   probably already have a favorite - I like Google.com, and will discuss
   it in a little more detail.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.1. Google.com

   This engine has several novel features that are described in its
   [40]Why use Google.com page In particular, the engine often returns
   the most useful pages first ; in fact, I have often found that the
   first listed page contains the information I need. Because it caches
   web pages, it is relatively fast at displaying requested items. It has
   a so-called GoogleScout (TM) feature that provides additional relevant
   links with each item returned.
   
   In addition, it has a specialized [41]Linux Search Engine that I use
   as my primary Internet search tool. It searches the database of
   linux-related pages at Google.com further promoting search efficiency.
   Try it- I am confident you will bookmark it immediately.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8. Mailing List Archives

   As you might expect, there are a very large number of linux-related
   Mailing Lists that enable developers and users to communicate and
   collaborate on projects. These Lists cover every conceivable aspect of
   Linux, from the technical arcana of kernel development to the
   relatively unfocused discussion of issues at the newbie level.
   Subscribers to a particular Mailing List are generally very
   knowledgeable in the List's topic, and detailed and useful information
   is often retrievable. The communications are publically accessible
   through Internet search engines and in the form of online Mailing List
   Archives. You will typically see archived pages when you conduct a
   search using an Internet search engine.
   
   Not all Mailing Lists are associated with an online archive, but this
   is increasingly the case. Similarly, not all archives have an
   associated search engine.
   
   Initially, try locate the Mailing List Archive you are interested in
   by typing a keyword/s and "mailing list archive" in an Internet search
   engine.
   
   For a listing of linux-related Mailing Lists, peruse websites such as
   the [42]Linux Resource Exchange and the [43]Linux Online Mailing Lists
   
   A relatively new, excellent Mailing List resource is [44]Geocrawler
   (The Knowledge Archive). This is a continuously updated, searchable
   archive of a large number of Lists that also allows one to register
   and subsequently post to any particular Mailing List. Its user
   interface is simple and its search function delivers messages very
   quickly. I highly recommend this site.
   
   You may also find Mailing List archives at the following locations :
   
     * The website of the distribution of Linux you use.
     * The website/s of the Window Manager and/or Desktop Environment you
       use.
     * The website dedicated to the application or project in question.
     * [45]The Mail Archive
     * [46]Mailing List Archives
     * [47]The Linux Mailing List Archives
     * [48]Tux Mailing List Archives
       
   This is not a complete listing of archives and you may find additional
   sites with an Internet search engine. But, this should certainly get
   you going.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
9. Online User's Manuals

   Some of the major Linux distributions and Window Managers/Desktop
   Environments publish their user's manual online. If the entire manual
   is not online, installation and configuration guides are typically
   found at the relevant website . This also applies to major
   applications like the Gimp ( GNU Image Manipulation Program).
   
   So, for those users who do not have the printed manual, a wealth of
   installation and configuration guidance is generally available online.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
10. Online Unix References and Tutorials

   As Linux is a Unix-like operating system, a general familiarity with
   fundamental Unix concepts such as the Unix directory hierarchy and
   file permissions is essential. Fortunately, there are many Unix
   tutorials online that collectively cover everything a user might need
   to know to use Linux. I suggest you bookmark the following as an
   online reference library :
   
     * [49]The Command and Shell User's guide from the Digital Equipment
       Corporation is an excellent guide to the Unix Operating System.
       Bookmark the Index Page linked there as an online reference.
     * [50]UNIXhelp is mirrored on many servers around the world. It is a
       useful resource for newbies.
     * [51]Introduction to Unix also contains a useful [52]Unix Command
       Summary page with brief, but useful, explanations of commonly used
       Unix commands.
     * [53]Unix is a Four Letter Word... is another resource suitable for
       newbies.
     * [54]Unix Tools contains useful descriptions of utilities, such as
       tar, that are commonly used in daily work.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11. Linux Kernel Resources

   If you would like current information about the Linux kernel,
   [55]Kernelnotes.org is the site you should visit. At this site, you
   can find out information about the stable and development versions of
   the kernel, as well as information about upgrading the kernel. It has
   links to unofficial patches and drivers, and much more.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12. Miscellaneous Resources

   In this section, I provide a number of links to websites that I have
   found useful while learning to use Linux. This is an eclectic
   collection, but keep these handy.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.1. Release Notes and Available Documentation related to the XFree86 X -
Window Server

   This documentation accompanies each version of XFree86, and is
   available at the [56]XFree86 website. Whenever you have trouble with
   your X environment, peruse the notes applicable to your
   videocard/chipset. These typically provide details about the
   configuration of the X - window system relative to your card, and will
   enumerate any "options" you have to include in the XF86Config file
   that governs X.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.2. GNU Texinfo pages

   A great collection of pages is available at the [57]Geek Girl.com
   website. Included are links to pages on the following:
   
     * Bash - The Bourne-again shell
     * Configure - used when compiling programs from source code
     * G++ - the GNU C++ compiler
     * Gcc - the C compiler
     * Libc - the GNU C library
     * Make - a program for directing recompilation
       
   Note that some of these are included in the "docs" that come with
   Linux distributions. In general, these are detailed technical
   documents of particular interest to developers. However, if like me,
   you are not a programmer, you may peruse the introductory sections of
   these documents to get insight, for example, into those configureand
   make commands you use when installing applications from source code.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.3. GNU Software and Manuals

   Many important programs that are frequently utilized by the Linux user
   are GNU utilities - for example, the tar (archive) and gzip (
   compression ) programs. Descriptions of these programs are located at
   the [58]GNU.org website where many [59]Online Manuals may also be
   found.
   
   These manuals typically provide a lot more information than is found
   in the corresponding man page on your system. For example , compare
   the man page and online manual for the tar utility.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.4. Glossary of Linux-related terms

   The [60]First Linux online guide has a nice collection of terms and
   definitions, sorted alphabetically. Go here if you encounter a term
   that you have not seen before or do not understand.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.5. An online dictionary of computer and technology terms

   The [61]PC Webopedia consists of a large online dictionary of
   computer-related terms and a search engine that provides links to
   documents that discuss each item in more detail. For example, I used
   this site to learn the differences between ISA and PCI buses.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.6. A detailed Guide to Personal Computers

   The Topic Index to the voluminous hardware guide at [62]PC guide.com
   will give you a great idea of the contents of this website. I used it
   quite frequently when first installing Linux and configuring the X
   Window System. I learnt a lot about videocards and monitors, including
   the concepts of screen resolution, color depth etc., useful when
   troubleshooting X - display problems.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.7. Gary's Encyclopedia

   [63]Gary Momarison's website contains a very large number of sorted
   Linux-related links. You may use the "find" function in your browser
   to find links in a particular category. Peruse this website to
   appreciate what it has to offer.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
13. Concluding Comments

   If you are a Linux newbie, you may want to create a Troubleshooting
   folder in your browser's bookmark list, into which you put the
   hyperlinks I have included in this document, as well as those
   pertinent to the distribution of Linux and the Window Manager/Desktop
   Environment you use.
   
   As you use these links , you will quickly become adept at
   troubleshooting online.
   
   Cheers and happy searching !
