  1.  Introduction



  1.1.  Why This HOWTO


  Current distributions are approaching perfection, but some fine-tuning
  is still needed. Many new users are intimidated by the apparent
  complexity of a Linux system, and as a result I note that the same
  questions crop up on c.o.l.setup over and over again. To try and
  remedy this situation, and for my own convenience, I wrote a to--do
  list that eventually became this HOWTO.  Here you will find
  configuration tips and examples for the most common applications,
  programs, and services, which should save you a fair amount of time
  and work.

  I realise that this HOWTO is quite RedHat-centric. Currently, I only
  have access to Red Hat and Mandrake machines, kernels ranging from
  2.0.36 to 2.2.15; so don't take any of my tips as gospel if you have
  other distributions. Previous versions of this HOWTO provided some
  information for SuSE, Debian and Caldera; but as I no longer have
  access to those machines, I can't keep the details up-to-date. No
  information is better that inaccurate information, so it's up to you
  to to adapt my tips to your distribution.

  This HOWTO can't, and is not meant to, replace others. Reading docs
  and HOWTOs always pays, so you're strongly advised to do so if you
  want to know more. Also, no spoon--feeding here: if you realise you
  don't understand something, please refer to the relevant HOWTO. Let me
  remind you that the right place for seeking help with Linux
  configuration is Usenet, i.e.  <news:comp.os.linux.setup>. Please,
  don't seek help from me because I'm quite overloaded.

  The official place for this document, which also hosts all other
  HOWTOs I refer to and some translations, is
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org>.



  1.2.  What We Will Be Configuring


  There can be endless hardware configurations for a PC, but in my
  experience one is quite common: a PC fitted with a large HD split into
  three partitions (one for DOS/Windows, one for Linux, one for the
  swap), sound card, modem, CD--ROM drive, printer, mouse. A parallel
  port Zip Drive is also very common. This machine is possibly part of a
  mixed Windows-Linux network, where it acts as server.


  This is the hardware I'll assume you want to configure, but it's easy
  to adapt the following tips to different configurations. It's
  implicitly assumed that you'll be root when editing/fixing/hacking.

  And now, lads, sleeves up.



  2.  General System Setup



  2.1.  A Few Words About Security


  Even before your system boots, you should decide what level of
  security you want to implement. To begin with, don't connect your
  machine to the network until you have decided what to do.

  Security is a vast subject that goes beyond the scope of this HOWTO;
  two good starting points are the Linux Security Administrator's Guide
  at  <http://www.securityportal.com/lasg> and the Linux Security Guide
  at <http://nic.com/~dave/SecurityAdminGuide/index.html>. You should
  consider at least the following steps: using shadow passwords (Shadow
  Password HOWTO), restricting network access to the machine (Section
  ``Restricting Network Access''), using the Secure Shell (
  <http://www.openssh.org>) or the Secure Remote Password (
  <http://srp.stanford.edu/srp/>). Good luck.



  2.2.  Start the Logbook!


  To keep your installation in shape, it's essential that you know
  exactly what happened to your machine, which packages you installed
  that day, what you removed or modified, and so on. So, the first thing
  you'll do before you tamper with your machine is start a ``logbook''.
  Therein you'll take note of every move you make as root; in my own
  logbook I also keep a section where I list all modified system files,
  additional .rpms, and .tar.gz I installed. Optimally, backtracking
  your moves you should be able to re-obtain a fresh installation.

  Make a backup copy of the system files you touch. Better still, use
  RCS; you'll be able to backtrack all changes. Never work as root
  without logging your moves!



  2.3.  Keyboard


  If you missed this step during installation or have changed your
  keyboard, you'll have to:


  ·  look for a suitable key table starting from
     /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/i386; for example, querty/it-latin1.kmap.gz
     supports the Italian keyboard;

  ·  edit the file /etc/sysconfig/keyboard so as it reads: KEYTABLE="it-
     latin1";

  ·  to set up the keyboard repeat rate and delay time, add this line to
     /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:
       /sbin/kbdrate -s -r 16 -d 500  # or whatever you like



  To load the key table, issue



       /etc/rc.d/init.d/keytable start



  Other special keys will be dealt with in the following sections. To
  enable NumLock on by default, add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:



       for tty in /dev/tty[1-9]*; do
         setleds -D +num < $tty
       done



  Normally, the Linux console doesn't distinguish between, say, Arrow
  and Shift-arrow, but some applications (namely, the editor ``Jed'')
  do. Normally, these key bindings are only available in xterm.  The
  following key map, which you can choose to load at boot time, is very
  handy:



  # Load this key map with: loadkey shift.map
  # Shift + Up
  shift keycode 103 = F100
  string F100 = "\033[a"
  # Shift + Left
  shift keycode 106 = F101
  string F101 = "\033[c"
  # Shift + Right
  shift keycode 105 = F102
  string F102 = "\033[d"
  # Shift + Down
  shift keycode 108 = F103
  string F103 = "\033[b"
  # Ctrl + Ins
  control keycode 110 = F104
  string F104="\033[2^"
  # Shift + Ins
  shift keycode 110 = F105
  string F105="\033[2$"
  # Shift + PgUp
  shift keycode 104 = F106
  string F106 = "\033[5$"
  # Shift + PgDn
  shift keycode 109 = F107
  string F107 = "\033[6$"
  # Shift + Home
  shift keycode 102 = F108
  string F108 = "\033[1$"
  # Shift + End
  shift keycode 107 = F109
  string F109 = "\033[4$"
  # Shift + Del
  shift keycode 111 = F110
  string F110 = "\033[3$"
  # Ctrl + Del
  control keycode 111 = F111
  string F111 = "\033[3^"



  2.4.  Boot and Rescue Floppy


  Make a couple of boot floppies for your newly installed system. Your
  distribution may include a command for creating such a floppy (say,
  mkbootdisk or something like that); if not, these commands will do:



       #~ dd if=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7 of=/dev/fd0  # use your kernel image
       #~ rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/hda2                     # your Linux root partition



  Also, have at least a couple of rescue disks ready. There's a wide
  choice of rescue disks at
  <ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/recovery>; if you don't know
  which one to choose, I suggest you try out Tomsbtrt, whose home page
  is  <http://www.toms.net/rb>. It's very complete, but some utilities
  seem missing at first; for example, ftp is not there but you get nc
  (netcat) instead. Please read its documentation.
  2.5.  Kernel Matters


  IMHO, the first thing to do next is build a kernel that best suits
  your system. It's very simple to do but, in any case, refer to the
  README file in /usr/src/linux/ or the Kernel HOWTO.  Hints:


  ·  consider carefully your needs. Choosing a kernel configuration,
     applying the patches, and compiling it once and for all is more
     productive than reconfiguring and recompiling each month; this is
     especially true if your Linux box is a server. Don't forget to
     include support for all the hardware you might likely add in the
     future (e.g. SCSI, Zip, network cards, etc); using modules is
     usually the best choice;

  ·  notebook users: if you plan to use a PCMCIA modem/fax, remember to
     compile serial support in the kernel. Don't compile it as a module,
     or your PCMCIA modem won't work;

  ·  remember to compile everything you need; i.e., don't forget the
     pcmcia modules, or the ALSA sound drivers;

  ·  to save time the next time you reconfigure and recompile the
     kernel, it's a good idea to save your configuration on a file and
     keep it in a safe place. If you upgrade the kernel and use ``make
     oldconfig'', your old config file will be taken and any not
     included features will be prompted whether they should be included,
     resulting in a new, upgraded config file.



  2.6.  Hard Disk Performance


  Your (E)IDE hard disk's performance can be greatly enhanced by
  carefully using hdparm(8). If your Linux distribution doesn't include
  it, you'll find on <ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/hardware>;
  look for a file called hdparm-X.Y.tar.gz.

  Since many details depend on your hard disk and HD controller, I can't
  give you a general recipe. You risk to toast your filesystem, so read
  the man page carefully before using some of the options. At its
  simplest, you could add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:



       /sbin/hdparm -c1 /dev/hda  # first IDE drive assumed



  which enables (E)IDE 32-bit I/O support. As for the `-m' option, this
  is what hdparm author Mark Lord emailed me:


       (...) if your system uses components from the past couple of
       years [< 1997], it will be fine. Older than that, there
       *may* be a problem (unlikely). The really buggy chips were
       the CMD0646 and RZ1000 chips, used *extensively* on 486 and
       (early) 586 motherboards about 2-3 years ago.


  For recent machines, these settings should work fine:


       /sbin/hdparm -c1 -A1 -m16 -d1 /dev/hda



  2.7.  Parallel Port Zip Drive


  Stock kernels include the driver for both old (ppa) and new (imm) Zip
  drives. If you recompile the kernel, make sure that SCSI support and
  SCSI disk support are enabled. Remember, there can be conflicts
  between the printer and the Zip drive on the same parallel port, so
  you have better use kernel modules.

  Zip disks are sold preformatted on partition /dev/sda4. To enable the
  Zip, append this to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:



       # Enable the Zip drive
       /sbin/modprobe ppa  # imm for recent models



  Zip disks can be mounted via /etc/fstab as shown below, or via Mtools
  adding this line to your /etc/mtools.conf:



       drive z: file="/dev/sda4" exclusive



  besides, the command mzip allows you to eject, query the status, write
  and password protect Zip disks; man mzip for details.  The Mtools home
  page is at <http://linux.wauug.org/pub/knaff/mtools>.



  2.8.  Device Drivers


  Devices in /dev (or better, links to the actual device drivers) may be
  missing. Check what devices your mouse, modem, and CD--ROM drive
  correspond to, then do what follows:



       ~# cd /dev
       /dev# ln -s ttyS0 mouse; ln -s ttyS1 modem; ln -s hdb cdrom; ln -s sda4 zip



  In most notebooks the mouse device is /dev/psaux: take this into
  account when configuring X11. If you wish, do chmod 666 to these
  devices to make them fully accessible by every user.



  2.9.  Sound Card


  My desktop PC is fitted with an old Sound Blaster 16; even if you've
  got something different, you may take what follows as guidelines.

  I compiled the sound card support as a module (sb.o).  Then I put this
  in /etc/conf.modules:



       options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330
       alias sound sb



  To enable the sound, make sure that modprobe sound is invoked in
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit. Alternatively, get the tool sndconfig from the
  RedHat site.

  Besides the standard kernel sound drivers, the Alsa drivers (
  <http://www.alsa-project.org>) are an excellent choice. Strangely,
  though, the sound channels are muted by default. You'll want to use
  aumix and this /etc/aumixrc to set the volume to 100%:



       vol:100:100:P
       synth:100:100:P
       pcm:100:100:P
       line:100:100:P
       mic:100:100:R
       cd:100:100:P



  2.10.  Login Messages


  If you wish to customise the login messages, check whether your
  /etc/rc.d/rc.local overwrites /etc/issue and /etc/motd. (RedHat does.)
  If so, get on with your editor.

  If you'd like a colourised login message, you may adapt your rc.local
  inserting lines like these:



       # put a real escape character instead of ^[. To do this:
       # emacs: ^Q ESC   vi: ^V ESC   joe:  ` 0 2 7   jed: ` ESC
       ESC="^["  # a real escape character
       BLUE="$ESC[44;37m"
       NORMAL="$ESC[40;37m"
       CLEAR="$ESC[H$ESC[J"

       > /etc/issue
       echo "$CLEAR" >> /etc/issue
       echo "$BLUE   Welcome to MyServer (192.168.1.1)   " >> /etc/issue
       echo "$NORMAL " >> /etc/issue
       echo "" >> /etc/issue


  2.11.  Hostname


  Issuing the command hostname new_host_name may not be enough. To avoid
  the dreaded sendmail lock, follow these steps (only valid for a
  stand--alone machine):


  ·  edit /etc/sysconfig/network and change the hostname therein (e.g.
     new_host_name.your_domain);

  ·  edit /etc/HOSTNAME appropriately;

  ·  append the new hostname in the line in /etc/hosts:


       127.0.0.1       localhost  new_host_name.your_domain



  2.12.  Mouse


  gpm mouse services are useful to perform cut and paste in tty mode,
  and to use the mouse in some applications. Make sure that you have a
  file called /etc/sysconfig/mouse and that it reads:



       MOUSETYPE="Microsoft"
       XEMU3=yes



  Moreover, you must have a file /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm, where you'll put
  additional command line parameters. Mine reads:



       ...
              daemon gpm -t $MOUSETYPE -d 2 -a 5 -B 132 # two-button mouse
       ...



  Obviously, make sure this configuration is right for your mouse type.
  In most notebooks, MOUSETYPE is ``PS/2''.

  If you like to use menus in console with Ctrl-button, then configure
  gpm-root. Edit the default menu in /etc/gpm-root.conf, then launch
  gpm-root from /etc/rc.d/rc.local.



  2.13.  Mount Points


  It's handy to have mount points for the floppy, other devices and NFS-
  exported directories. For example, you can do the following:

       ~# cd /mnt; mkdir floppy cdrom win zip server



  This creates mount points for a DOS/Win floppy, the CD--ROM, the
  Windows partition, the parallel port Zip drive, and an NFS directory.

  Now edit the file /etc/fstab and add the following entries:



       /dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy     auto            user,noauto 0 1
       /dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660         ro,user,noauto 0 1
       /dev/zip        /mnt/zip        vfat            user,noauto,exec 0 1
       /dev/hda1       /mnt/win        vfat            user,noauto 0 1
       server:/export  /mnt/server     nfs             defaults



  Obviously, you must use the correct device in the first field.

  Note the `auto' filesystem type in the first line; it allows you to
  mount both ext2 and vfat (DOS/Windows) floppies, but you need a recent
  version of mount. You may find mtools more convenient.



  2.14.  Automount Points


  If you don't like the mounting/unmounting thing, consider using
  autofs(5). You tell the autofs daemon what to automount and where
  starting with a file, /etc/auto.master. Its structure is simple:



       /misc   /etc/auto.misc
       /mnt    /etc/auto.mnt



  In this example you tell autofs to automount media in /misc and /mnt,
  while the mountpoints are specified in /etc/auto.misc and
  /etc/auto.mnt. An example of /etc/auto.misc:



       # an NFS export
       server          -ro                     my.buddy.net:/pub/export
       # removable media
       cdrom           -fstype=iso9660,ro      :/dev/hdb
       floppy          -fstype=auto            :/dev/fd0



  Start the automounter. From now on, whenever you try to access the
  inexistent mount point /misc/cdrom, il will be created and the CD-ROM
  will be mounted.



  2.15.  lilo(8) and LOADLIN.EXE


  Many users run both Linux and DOS/Windows on their PC, and want to
  choose at boot time which os to use; this should be done at install
  time, but in case, do what follows. Let's suppose that /dev/hda1
  contains DOS/Windows and that /dev/hda2 contains Linux.



       ~# fdisk
       Using /dev/hda as default device!

       Command (m for help):a
       Partition number (1-4): 2

       Command (m for help):w
       ~#



  This makes the Linux partition bootable. Then write this basic
  /etc/lilo.conf file:



       boot = /dev/hda2
       compact                # may conflict with "linear"
       delay = 100            # 10 seconds
       linear                 # gets rid of the "1024 cylinder" problem
       message = /boot/bootmesg.txt  # write your own, if you will
       root = current
       image = /boot/vmlinuz  # boot linux by default as this entry comes first
         label = linux
         read-only
       #  append="mem=128M"   # to see more memory than 64M
       other = /dev/hda1
         table = /dev/hda
         label = win



  Now issue /sbin/lilo and you're done. Being lilo a crucial part of
  your installation, you're strongly advised to read its documentation
  anyway.

  To boot Linux from DOS/Windows without resetting, put LOADLIN.EXE in a
  directory (in the DOS partition!) included in the DOS path; then copy
  your kernel to, say, C:\TEMP\VMLINUZ. The following simple .BAT file
  will boot Linux:



       rem   linux.bat
       smartdrv /C
       loadlin c:\temp\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda2 ro



  If you use Windows 9x, set the properties of this .BAT so as it starts
  in MS--DOS mode.


  2.15.1.  Security Tip


  Making a backup copy of your MBR before installing Linux is a safe
  move.  Prepare a Windows rescue floppy, and make sure it includes
  FDISK.EXE.  To restore the MBR, all you have to do is



       A:\> fdisk /mbr



  art MIME format. These two lines, put in -*- etc/mailcap, should let
  you read those messages: -*- -*-


        -*- text/plain; less %s; needsterminal
        -*- text/html; lynx -force_html %s; needsterminal
        -*-



  -->


  2.16.  Printer Configuration


  All distributions I know have a configuration tool for setting up the
  printer (printtool, yast, or magicfilter); if you don't have it, this
  is a basic manual configuration.

  Let's suppose you have a non--PostScript (non ``Windows-only'' too!)
  printer you want to use to print raw text (e.g., C source files) and
  PostScript files via Ghostscript, which is assumed to be already
  installed.

  Setting up the printer involves a few steps:


  ·  find out which one the parallel print device is: try



       ~# echo "hello, world" > /dev/lp0
       ~# echo "hello, world" > /dev/lp1



  and take note which one works.

  ·  make two spool directories:



       ~# cd /var/spool/lpd
       /var/spool/lpd/# mkdir raw; mkdir postscript



  ·  if your printer exibits the ``staircase effect'' (most inkjets do),
     you'll need a filter. Try to print two lines with



       ~# echo "first line" > /dev/lp1 ; echo "second line" > /dev/lp1



  if the output is like this:



       first line
                 second line



  then save this script as /var/spool/lpd/raw/filter:



       #!/bin/sh
       # This filter eliminates the "staircase effect"
       awk '{print $0, "\r"}'



  and make it executable with chmod 755 /var/spool/lpd/raw/filter.

  ·  make a filter for PostScript emulation. Write the following filter
     as /var/spool/lpd/postscript/filter:



       #!/bin/sh

       DEVICE=djet500
       RESOLUTION=300x300
       PAPERSIZE=a4
       SENDEOF=

       nenscript -TUS -ZB -p- |
       if [ "$DEVICE" = "PostScript" ]; then
         cat -
       else
         gs -q -sDEVICE=$DEVICE \

       if [ "$SENDEOF" != "" ]; then
         printf "\004"
       fi



  (in this example an HP DeskJet printer is assumed. Adapt it to your
  printer).

  ·  finally, add the following entries in /etc/printcap:



       # /etc/printcap
       lp|ps|PS|PostScript|djps:\
               :sd=/var/spool/lpd/postscript:\
               :mx#0:\
               :lp=/dev/lp1:\
               :if=/var/spool/lpd/postscript/filter:\
               :sh:
       raw:\
               :sd=/var/spool/lpd/raw:\
               :mx#0:\
               :lp=/dev/lp1:\
               :if=/var/spool/lpd/raw/filter:\
               :sh:



  For more complex or exotic printing configurations, the Printing-HOWTO
  awaits you.

  If you use printtool, be aware that the GSDEVICE chosen by Printtool
  will work, but not necessarily at its best for your printer. You may
  consider fiddling a bit with the file postscript.cfg; for instance, I
  changed GSDEVICE from cdj500 to djet500 and now my prints come out
  much quicker.



  2.17.  SVGATextMode


  This utility, available on
  <ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/sources/sbin>, is useful for changing
  the console screen resolution, font, and cursor shape. Users whose
  language include accented characters will be able to use them in
  console applications, while notebook users may change the cursor shape
  to make it more visible.

  Edit /etc/TextConfig or /etc/TextMode, starting with the default VGA
  definition. Europeans should be happy with this ``LoadFont'' section:



       Option "LoadFont"
       FontProg "/usr/bin/setfont"
       FontPath "/usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts"
       FontSelect "lat1u-16.psf"   8x16 9x16 8x15 9x15
       FontSelect "lat1u-14.psf"   8x14 9x14 8x13 9x13
       FontSelect "lat1u-12.psf"   8x12 9x12 8x11 9x11
       FontSelect "lat1u-08.psf"   8x8  9x8  8x7  9x7



  Once you're done, try your configuration with a command like
  SVGATextMode "80x34x9", and if everything appears to be working fine,
  remove the warnings from /etc/TextMode and include this line in
  etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:
       # SVGATextMode
       /usr/sbin/SVGATextMode "80x34x9"



  Please note that the block cursor only works with some modes; on my
  notebook, "80x30x9".



  3.  Common Administration Tasks


  Here is where the fun begins. This section is rather network-centric,
  though many other tasks await you.

  Networking is a vast subject which cannot be fully covered here. The
  reference is the NET-3 HOWTO, and most distributions provide
  documentation on setting up network services. Only a few points will
  be recalled here.

  A quick to-do list for the services you may want to install: cron and
  timed tasks like calendar or reminder, Http, Samba, telnet/ssh access,
  anonymous ftp, POP/IMAP server, NFS...



  3.1.  Network Configuration


  If your network card wasn't recognised at install time, don't worry:
  in most cases it's either NE2000 or 3c59x compatible. Issue the
  command modprobe ne or modprobe 3c59x and see if the relevant module
  is loaded, then add this line in /etc/conf.modules:



       alias eth0 ne  # or 3c59x



  Now you're ready to use netcfg or similar tool to set up the network
  configuration. The relevant files are /etc/HOSTNAME, etc/hosts,
  /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/sysconfig/network, and /etc/sysconfig/network-
  scripts/ifcfg-eth0; services should be started with scripts in
  /etc/rc.d/init.d.

  This is a sample etc/hosts:



       127.0.0.1               localhost
       192.168.1.1             paleo.eocene.net        paleo
       192.168.1.2             nautilus.eocene.net     nautilus



  This is /etc/resolv.conf:



  search df.unibo.it,eocene.net
  nameserver 195.210.91.100



  This is /etc/sysconfig/network (Red Hat-dependent):



       NETWORKING=false
       FORWARD_IPV4=true
       HOSTNAME=nautilus.eocene.net
       DOMAINNAME=eocene.net



  And finally, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. This one, too,
  is Red Hat-dependent; it must be executable.



       DEVICE=eth0
       IPADDR=192.168.1.2
       NETMASK=255.255.255.0
       NETWORK=192.168.1.0
       BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
       ONBOOT=no



  Although the actual method of starting network services of your
  distribution may be much more complex, the following script should be
  enough to get you started:



       #!/bin/sh

       # net-up.sh: set up network access

       DEVICE=eth0
       IPADDR=192.168.1.100
       NETMASK=255.255.255.0
       NETWORK=192.168.1.0
       GATEWAY=192.168.1.1

       ifconfig $DEVICE $IPADDR netmask $NETMASK up
       route add -net $NETWORK netmask $NETMASK $DEVICE
       route add default gw $GATEWAY



  This script is handy for enabling network access when you use a rescue
  disk.  Obviously, this lets you only ping, ftp and telnet to the
  outside; it won't start any daemon.



  3.2.  Network for Notebooks



  When you plug the network PC card in, the script /etc/pcmcia/network
  will be executed. All it needs is a properly set up
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.

  Setting up the network can become a bit trickier, though. In fact, you
  must provide the right settings for each network you connect to, as
  well as settings for the notebook when it's not connected.

  I rolled up a rough but functional solution. I use my notebook as a
  stand-alone machine, connecting to the net via PPP; at home, IP
  address 192.168.1.2; and at university, IP 137.204.x.y. So, I created
  a set of configuration files for each network; all these are kept in
  /etc/mobnet. A script is then used to select the working environment.
  For instance, this is /etc/mobnet/home.cfg:



       # /etc/mobnet/home.conf

       HOSTNAME=nautilus.eocene.net    # complete hostname
       DOMAINNAME=eocene.net           # your domain
       IPADDR=192.168.1.2
       NETMASK=255.255.255.0
       NETWORK=192.168.1.0
       BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
       GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
       FORWARD_IPV4=true
       NAMESERVER=195.210.91.100       # required
       SEARCH=df.unibo.it,eocene.net   # optional
       SERVICES="inet httpd smb sshd"



  This is mnet, the script I use to choose the network profile:



  #!/bin/sh
  # mnet: script to set up the "mobile network" configuration.
  # Last modified: 15 July 2000

  # start or stop services
  activate_services()
  {
    for service in $(echo $SERVICES) ; do
      [ -x /etc/rc.d/init.d/$service ] && /etc/rc.d/init.d/$service $1
    done
  }

  # usage
  if [ $# = 0 ] ; then
    echo "Usage: mnet <config name>"
    echo "Example: mnet office"
    exit 1
  fi

  # check if the configuration exists
  if [ ! -e /etc/mobnet/$1.conf ]; then
    echo "This configuration doesn't exist."
    exit 1
  fi

  # read the configuration
  . /etc/mobnet/$1.conf

  # set up the host name
  echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/HOSTNAME
  /bin/hostname $HOSTNAME

  # set up the name server(s)
  cat <<EOF > /etc/resolv.conf
  # /etc/resolv.conf
  search $SEARCH
  nameserver $NAMESERVER
  EOF

  # stop previous services, if any
  if [ -f /etc/mobnet/services.prev ]; then
    NEWSERVICES=$SERVICES
    . /etc/mobnet/services.prev
    activate_services stop
    SERVICES=$NEWSERVICES
  fi

  if [ $1 != "none" ]; then
  # set up the network parameters
    cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/network
    NETWORKING=yes
    FORWARD_IPV4=true
    HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME
    DOMAINNAME=$DOMAINNAME
    GATEWAY=$GATEWAY
    GATEWAYDEV=eth0
  EOF

    cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    DEVICE=eth0
    IPADDR=$IPADDR
    NETMASK=$NETMASK
    NETWORK=$NETWORK
    BROADCAST=$BROADCAST
    ONBOOT=no
  EOF
    /bin/chmod +x /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

    # copy the other config files
    /bin/cp -f /etc/mobnet/hosts.$1       /etc/hosts
    /bin/cp -f /etc/mobnet/smb.conf.$1    /etc/smb.conf

    echo -n "Insert the network PC card and press <enter> when done: "
    read

    # OK, now start services
    activate_services start
    echo "SERVICES=\"$SERVICES\"" > /etc/mobnet/services.prev

  else # it's not "none"

    cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/network
    NETWORKING=false
    FORWARD_IPV4=false
    HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME
    DOMAINNAME=$DOMAINNAME
  EOF
    /bin/rm -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0*
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
    echo "SERVICES=$SERVICES" > /etc/mobnet/services.prev
    echo "Now you may remove the PC card."
    exit 0

  fi

  # end of mnet.



  As I said, it is rough and even not complete: other files may depend
  on the network, like /etc/fstab, /etc/exports, and /etc/printcap.
  Think about network printers and NFS shares.  Feel free to adapt this
  bare-bone solution to your needs.



  3.3.  Sharing the Internet


  One of the most useful tasks for a Linux server. Currently, most stock
  kernels come with IP firewalling, masquerading and forwarding enabled
  by default; if in doubt, consult the IP-Masquerade mini-HOWTO to learn
  how to enable them. Then install ipfwadm (kernels 2.0.x;
  <http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm/>) or ipchains (kernels 2.2.x;
  <http://www.adelaide.net.au/~rustcorp/ipfwchains/ipfwchains.html>).
  Remember to enable kernel modules for the services you need, e.g. for
  ftp you'll add this line to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysconfig:



       /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp



  Other modules are usually found in /lib/modules/KERNEL-VERSION/ipv4.

  Enabling IP masquerading for other machines in your local network is
  very simple. First, check the network initialisation scripts
  (/etc/sysconfig/network should be the right place) to see if they
  contain a line that reads FORWARD_IPV4=true. It's used to set
  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1 when the network subsystem comes
  up.

  Add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:



       # default: packets cannot reach the outside
       /sbin/ipfwadm -F -p deny
       # allow all machines on the local network to reach the Internet
       /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
       # alternatively, allow only these two machines
       # /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.100/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
       # /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.101/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0



  If you use a kernel of the 2.2.x series, use ipfwadm-wrapper instead
  of ipfwadm to get started quickly.  More information at
  <http://ipmasq.cjb.net>.

  Now you'll want something to let client machines dial the ISP; I use
  Mserver ( <http://cpwright.villagenet.com/mserver/>). Edit
  etc/mserver.conf; the only entries that you should modify are
  ``checkhost'', ``shadow'', and ``cname''. Then define your
  connection(s).  Obviously, install a suitable client on the client
  machines.



  3.4.  Restricting Network Access


  Let's suppose you connect to the Internet via PPP. Once you're
  connected, your machine may become vulnerable to attacks. Insert this
  in /etc/hosts.allow:



       # only allow access to localhost
       ALL: 127.



  and this in /etc/hosts.deny:



       # deny access to everyone
       ALL: ALL



  If you belong to a network with direct Internet access, you had better
  disable finger, telnet, and possibly other services for security
  reasons; use ssh instead of telnet. The file to edit is
  /etc/inet.conf. Alternatively, you can restrict network access putting
  this in /etc/hosts.allow:



  in.telnetd: 192.168.1., .another.trusted.network
  in.ftpd: 192.168.1., .another.trusted.network



  and this in /etc/hosts.deny:



       in.telnetd: ALL
       in.ftpd: ALL



  3.5.  NFS Exports



  It is common to export home directories on the server; a problem
  arises if a user's UID and GID are not consistent across different
  machines.  If user `guido' has UID/GID = 500 on server and UID/GID =
  512 on client, a convenient configuration is this:



       # /etc/exports
       /tmp            my.client.machine(rw)
       /home/guido     my.client.machine(rw,all_squash,anonuid=512,anongid=512)



  3.6.  Samba


  Almost trivial, but there's always a little bit to do. If you want to
  connect Windows 98/NT clients, did you remember to read the docs and,
  in case, enable clear text passwords? The distribution includes .reg
  files for Win9x/NT/2000; if your clients can't connect to the Linux
  server, load them on every client.

  Samba comes with a fairly complete sample /etc/smb.conf, but strangely
  it lacks a section showing how to (un)mount removable media. The
  clauses preexec and postexec do the trick:



       [cdrom]
         comment = CD-ROM
         path = /mnt/cdrom
         public = yes
         read only = yes
       ; you might need to use "root preexec/postexec"
         preexec = mount /mnt/cdrom
         postexec = umount /mnt/cdrom



  Also: you know what Swat is, don't you? Enable it adding this line in
  your /etc/inetd.conf:



       swat      stream  tcp     nowait.400      root /usr/sbin/swat swat



  and this in /etc/services:



       swat            901/tcp



  Restart inetd with SIGHUP, and point your browser to
  http://localhost:901.



  4.  Software Configuration


  These are the the configuration files we are going to custimise:
  /etc/profile /etc/bashrc .bashrc .bashrc .bash_profile .bash_logout
  .inputrc .less .lessrc .xinitrc .fvwmrc .fvwm2rc95 .Xmodmap
  .Xmodmap.num .Xdefaults .jedrc .abbrevs.sl .joerc .emacs .  Don't add
  users until you have completed your system configuration; you'll put
  the dot files in /etc/skel.



  4.1.  bash(1)


  Arguably, the most important piece of software after the kernel. To
  tailor the behaviour of bash, these are the main files to edit:


  ·  /etc/bashrc contains system wide aliases and functions;

  ·  /etc/profile contains system wide environment stuff and startup
     programs;

  ·  $HOME/.bashrc contains user aliases and functions;

  ·  $HOME/.bash_profile contains user environment stuff and startup
     programs;

  ·  $HOME/.inputrc contains key bindings and other bits.

  Examples of these files are shown below. First, the most important:
  /etc/profile. It's used to configure a lot of features in your Linux
  box, as you will see in the following sections. Please look out for
  reverse quotes!



  ______________________________________________________________________

  # $HOME/.bash_profile

  ______________________________________________________________________



  To make the backspace and delete keys work correctly in xterm and
  other X11 applications, the following is also needed:


  ·  put this in your .xinitrc:



       usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
       xmodmap $usermodmap



  ·  then your .Xmodmap will contain:



       keycode 22 = BackSpace
       keycode 107 = Delete



  this fixes the console. To fix xterm:

  ·  put this in your .Xdefaults:



       xterm*VT100.Translations: #override <Key>BackSpace: string(0x7F)\n\
               <Key>Delete:        string(0x1b) string("[3~")\n\
               <Key>Home:          string(0x1b) string("[1~")\n\
               <Key>End:           string(0x1b) string("[4~")\n\
               Ctrl<Key>Prior:     string(0x1b) string("[40~")\n\
               Ctrl<Key>Next:      string(0x1b) string("[41~")

       nxterm*VT100.Translations: #override <Key>BackSpace: string(0x7F)\n\
               <Key>Delete:        string(0x1b) string("[3~")\n\
               <Key>Home:          string(0x1b) string("[1~")\n\
               <Key>End:           string(0x1b) string("[4~")\n\
               Ctrl<Key>Prior:     string(0x1b) string("[40~")\n\
               Ctrl<Key>Next:      string(0x1b) string("[41~")

  rxvt is a wee bit more complicated, as some compile--time options
  influence its behaviour. See the above /etc/profile.

  More info in bash(1) and readline(3) man pages.

  Don't expect every application to work correctly! If you run joe in
  xterm, for instance, some keys won't work; the same holds for some
  versions of rxvt.



  4.2.  I18n


  (This section doesn't apply to native English speakers.)

  A.k.a. ``internationalisation''. Gasp. This long word means ``to adapt
  Linux to your local conventions: language, format of date, currency
  etc.''.

  Although Red Hat has its own method for setting up i18n
  (/etc/sysconfig/i18n), you may want to enable your language only in
  some cases. I, for one, enabled i18n in kdm (via kdmconfig) and xfce,
  but want to read English messages when I work in console or xterm.

  Consider these lines:



       LANG=it # choose your language: fr, de, es, ...
       LANGUAGE=it
       LC_ALL=it
       export LANG LANGUAGE LC_ALL



  If you insert them in your .xinitrc or .xsession just before the line
  that starts the window manager, you'll get internationalised messages
  - including those in xterms started from within the window manager.
  But if you'd rather get English messages, set the language to ``en''
  and put the same lines in .bash_profile.



  4.3.  ls(1)


  ls can display directory listings using colours to highlight different
  file types. To enable this feature, you just need a couple of lines in
  /etc/profile as seen above. However, this won't work with old versions
  of rxvt; use some flavour of xterm instead. It looks like some old
  rxvts have a bug that prevents them from inheriting the environment
  correctly in some circumstances.



  4.4.  less(1)


  With this excellent pager you can browse not only plain text files,
  but also gzip compressed, tar and zip archives, man pages, and what
  have you. Its configuration involves a few steps:



  ·  to use it with the movement keys, have this plain ASCII file
     .lesskey in your home directory:



       ^[[A   back-line
       ^[[B   forw-line
       ^[[C   right-scroll
       ^[[D   left-scroll
       ^[OA   back-line
       ^[OB   forw-line
       ^[OC   right-scroll
       ^[OD   left-scroll
       ^[[6~  forw-scroll
       ^[[5~  back-scroll
       ^[[1~  goto-line
       ^[[4~  goto-end
       ^[[7~  goto-line
       ^[[8~  goto-end



  then run the command lesskey. (These are escape sequences for
  vt100-like terminals.) This creates a binary file .less containing the
  key bindings.


  ·  write the following file as /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh:


     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/bin/sh
     # This is a preprocessor for 'less'.  It is used when this environment
     # variable is set:   LESSOPEN="|lesspipe.sh %s"

     lesspipe() {
       case "$1" in
       *.tar) tar tf $1 2>/dev/null ;; # View contents of .tar and .tgz files
       *.tgz|*.tar.gz|*.tar.Z|*.tar.z) tar ztf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
       *.Z|*.z|*.gz) gzip -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;; # View compressed files correctly
       *.bz2) bzip2 -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;;
       *.zip) unzip -l $1 2>/dev/null ;; # View archives
       *.arj) unarj -l $1 2>/dev/null ;;
       *.rpm) rpm -qpil $1 2>/dev/null ;;
       *.cpio) cpio --list -F $1 2>/dev/null ;;
       *.1|*.2|*.3|*.4|*.5|*.6|*.7|*.8|*.9|*.n|*.l|*.man) FILE=`file -L $1`
         FILE=`echo $FILE | cut -d ' ' -f 2`
         if [ "$FILE" = "troff" ]; then
           groff -s -p -t -e -Tascii -mandoc $1
         fi ;;
       *) file $1 | grep text > /dev/null ;
         if [ $? = 1 ] ; then # it's not some kind of text
           strings $1
         fi ;;
       esac
     }

     lesspipe $1
     ___________________________________________________________________



  then make it executable with chmod 755 lesspipe.sh.

  ·  put the variables that affect less in /etc/profile as seen above.



  4.5.  Editor


  Only the most popular will be covered here.



  4.5.1.  emacs(1)


  I rarely use emacs, so I have only a couple of tips for you.  Some
  emacs distributions don't come preconfigured for colours and syntax
  highlighting. Put this in your .emacs:



       (global-font-lock-mode t)
       (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)



  This only works in X11. Moreover, to enable accented characters you'll
  add this line:



       (standard-display-european 1)



  I'll leave it to you to peruse all of emacs' documentation to find out
  how to tailor it to your needs---potentially, it can take months of
  hacking.  The Dotfile generator (Section ``Configuration Software'')
  is a good helping hand.



  4.5.2.  joe(1)


  Some versions of joe don't work with colours in console, and some
  special keys don't work either. A quick and dirty (and inelegant)
  solution to the former problem is this:



       ~$ export TERM=vt100
       ~$ joe myfile
          (edit your file)
       ~$ export TERM=linux



  To make the special keys work, all you have to do is edit .joerc,
  .jstarrc or your favourite emulation; you can start from the system-
  wide config files in /usr/lib/joe. Look for the fourth section (key
  bindings). This enables Home and End:
       bol ^[ [ 1 ~    Go to beginning of line
       eol ^[ [ 4 ~    Go to end of line



  Find out the desired ESC sequences typing cat followed by the special
  keys.



  4.5.3.  jed(1)


  This is my favourite editor: it does what I need, it's lighter and
  easier to configure than emacs, and emulates other editors quite well.
  Many users at my university use jed to emulate EDT, VMS' system
  editor.

  jed's configuration files are .jedrc and /usr/lib/jed/lib/*; the
  former can be adapted from jed.rc in the latter directory.


  ·  if xjed apparently doesn't recognise the DEL key, add or comment
     out these lines in your .jedrc:



       #ifdef XWINDOWS
         x_set_keysym (0xFFFF, 0, "\e[3~");
         setkey (``delete_char_cmd'', "\e[3~");
       #endif



  ·  to make jed emulate EDT (or other editors) all you have to do is
     edit a couple of lines in .jedrc. If you want the numeric keypad
     `+' to delete words instead of a single character, add this in
     .jedrc:



       unsetkey("\eOl");
       unsetkey("\eOP\eOl");
       setkey("edt_wdel", "\eOl");
       setkey("edt_uwdel", "\eOP\eOl");



  after the line that reads () = evalfile("edt") (or similar);

  ·  to make xjed use the numeric keypad for EDT emulation, insert the
     following in .Xmodmap:



       keycode 77  = KP_F1
       keycode 112 = KP_F2
       keycode 63  = KP_F3
       keycode 82  = KP_F4
       keycode 86  = KP_Separator

  ·  colour customization for xjed is done adding lines like these in
     .Xdefaults:



       xjed*Geometry: 80x32+150+50
       xjed*font: 10x20
       xjed*background: midnight blue
       # and so on...



  ·  the ``abbreviation'' feature is an invaluable timesaver. Write a
     file like the following as $HOME/.abbrevs.sl (you can change this
     name by inserting variable Abbrev_File = "/usr/lib/jed/abbrev.sl";
     in .jedrc):



       create_abbrev_table ("Global", "0-9A-Za-z");
       define_abbrev ("Global", "GG", "Guido Gonzato");
       create_abbrev_table ("TeX", "\\A-Za-z0-9");
       define_abbrev ("TeX", "\\beq", "\\begin{equation}");
       define_abbrev ("TeX", "\\eeq", "\\end{equation}");
       % and so on...



  and type ESC x abbrev_mode to enable it. To enable the abbreviation by
  default, add entries like these to your .jedrc:



       define text_mode_hook ()
       {
         set_abbrev_mode (1);
       }
       %
       define fortran_hook ()
       {
         set_abbrev_mode (1);
         use_abbrev_table ("Fortran");
       }
       % and so on...



  4.6.  pine(1)


  Edit the global configuration in /usr/lib/pine.conf, taking care at
  least of the following fields: user-domain, smtp-server, and nntp-
  server. Note that inbox-path depends on your MTA: if you use sendmail
  or postfix, that'll be var/spool/mail/$USER; with Qmail,
  /home/$USER/Mailbox (but root will use /var/qmail/alias/Mailbox.



  4.7.  minicom(1)


  Users can't use minicom unless a global configuration has been made by
  root. Remember to make it.



  4.8.  efax(1)


  This package is probably the most convenient for simple
  sending/receiving of faxes. You'll have to tailor the script
  /usr/bin/fax or (mandrake) /etc/fax.config; easy job, but a couple of
  quirks caused me quite a headache:


  ·  to find out whether your modem is class 1, 2, or 2.0, use minicom
     or similar program to issue the command at+fclass=?. The reply may
     be like 0,1,2; 1 and 2 are the classes supported by your modem;

  ·  DIALPREFIX: chances are that simply putting `T' or `P' won't work
     in some countries-in Italy, at least. Put `ATDT' or `ATDP' instead;

  ·  INIT and RESET: these strings contain the initialisers `-i' and
     `-k', needed by efax. If you want to add an AT command, add it to
     the appropriate string leaving out `AT' and preceding the rest with
     either `-i' or `-k'. Example: to add the `ATX3' command to INIT,
     you'll append `-iX3'.

  That done, there are a few permissions to fix to enable non-root users
  to send and receive faxes. The directories /var/lock and
  /var/spool/fax must be writable. To do so, create the group faxusers,
  add users to it, then type:



       ~# chown root.faxusers /var/lock
       ~# mkdir /var/spool/fax # if it doesn't exist yet
       ~# chown root.faxusers /var/spool/fax; chmod g+w /var/spool/fax



  As a normal user, you'll issue newgrp faxusers before sendig a fax.



  4.9.  Ghostscript


  This essential tool suffers from a small snag. Owing to to the well-
  known export regulations in the USA, the utility pdf2ps doesn't work
  with encrypted .pdf files. Never mind: point your browser to
  <http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pdfencrypt>, download the file
  pdf_sec.ps and replace the file with the same name that comes with the
  Ghostscript distribution.



  4.10.  TeX and Friends


  The ``root'' of a TeX system is the directory $TEXMF, which is
  /usr/share/texmf in teTeX; other distributions may differ (search for
  ``texmf'' on your system). You normally add stuff or fiddle with files
  therein.



  4.10.1.  Expanding $TEXINPUTS



  To include PostScript figures or TeX files that reside in
  subdirectories, it is convenient to expand TeX's search path to
  include subdirectories. Put this command in your .bash_profile:



       export TEXINPUTS="$HOME/mylib::./figures"



  which makes TeX search in $HOME/mylib before the default directories,
  and the directory ./figures afterwards.



  4.10.2.  Hyphen Patterns


  To configure the hyphenation pattern for your language, edit the file
  $TEXMF/tex/generic/config/language.dat, then do:



       ~# texconfig init ; texconfig hyphen



  Even if you don't write in English, don't remove the entry
  ``english''; TeX pukes without it.



  4.10.3.  Dvips


  To tailor dvips, the file to edit is $TEXMF/dvips/config/config.ps. Be
  aware that the fields regarding the default resolution also affect
  xdvi's behaviour; if you experience annoying attempts to create fonts
  each time you run it, put the line



       XDvi*mfmode:



  in your .Xdefault. This should help.



  4.10.4.  Adding LaTeX Packages


  Additional LaTeX packages are available from your nearest CTAN
  (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) mirror site, e.g.
  <ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex>. Unpack the package under
  $TEXMF/tex/latex.

  If no .sty file exist, run the command latex newstyle.ins or latex
  newstyle.dtx to create it, then run the command texhash so that teTeX
  recognises the new package.



  4.11.  Avoid PPProblems!


  I'll take it for granted that your kernel has PPP + TCP/IP support
  compiled in, that loopback is enabled, and that you already have the
  pppd package correctly installed and, if you will, set uid root.
  Obviously, your ISP must support PPP.

  There are now two ways to get PPP to work: a) manual configuration,
  and b) a configuration program that automagically sees to it.
  Whichever option you choose, have the following information on hand:


  ·  your ISP's telephone number;

  ·  your ISP's name, mail and news server address;

  ·  your ISP's domain;

  ·  your username and password.

  Manual configuration is a drudgery. It's about editing files and
  writing scripts; not too much work, but it's easy to make mistakes and
  newcomers are often intimidated. The PPP HOWTO is there for you.
  Alternatively, there are tools that ask for the information above and
  do all the work.

  Gnome and KDE include, respectively, gnome-ppp and kppp which are easy
  enough to set up. Alternatively, I suggest that you have a look at a
  couple of tty--based tools, wvdial and eznet.  You feed them your
  ISP's phone number, your username, your password, and you're in
  business. Their home pages are at
  <http://www.worldvisions.ca/wvdial> and
  <http://www.hwaci.com/sw/eznet>. Both are great, but I prefer the
  latter.



  4.11.1.  A Quick Start with eznet


  First of all, create an /etc/resolv.conf like this:



       nameserver w.x.y.z



  where you'll insert the address of your ISP's nameserver. To create an
  account with eznet, issue the following command:



       #~ eznet add service=YOUR_ISP user=NAME password=PASSWORD phone=PHONE

  which creates the file /var/eznet/eznet.conf, owned by root.root with
  permissions 600; chmod it to 666 if you want it to be world readable.
  Now dial your ISP with eznet up YOUR_ISP. If the modem keeps waiting
  for the dial tone and won't connect, then try this command:



       #~ eznet change YOUR_ISP init0=atx3



  To hang up, the command is eznet down. That's all!



  4.11.2.  A Quick Start with wvdial


  wvdial's setup is even shorter. Type wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf, then
  edit the resulting file to include your username, password, and phone
  number. Try it out with wvdial, and keep your fingers crossed. To hang
  up, stop it with Ctrl-C.



  4.12.  POP Client


  To retrieve your mail from a POP3 server, you need a POP client. Most
  such clients require that you run an MTA like sendmail, qmail or
  postfix; a bit of an overkill on low-spec machines. However, there are
  clients that work without an MTA. The first kind is well represented
  by fetchmail; the second by fetchpop or frenchie. Sites:
  <ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/mail/pop>,
  <http://www.lowcountry.com/~jscottb/tcltk.shtml>.

  To configure these clients:


  ·  fetchpop: the first time you run it, you'll be prompted for some
     information. Answer the questions and you're set. fetchpop must be
     used with the -r switch if your ISP's POP3 server doesn't implement
     the command LAST properly.

  ·  frenchie: as above, edit  /.frenchie/frenchierc;

  ·  fetchmail: adapt this sample .fetchmailrc:



       # $HOME/.fetchmailrc
       poll mbox.myisp.com with protocol pop3;
         user john there with password _Loo%ny is john here



  One user reported that adding ``smtphost localhost'' to the second
  line improved performance dramatically.

  You must set the permissions to this file with the command chmod 600
  .fetchmailrc, otherwise fetchmail will rightly refuse to start. This
  example is very basic; there are endless possibilities of configura­
  tion. Check out at  <http://www.ccil.org/~esr/fetchmail>.
  4.13.  Basic Mail Filtering


  You will want to protect yourself from spam or huge mail messages.
  There are two cases: 1) permanent connection to the net, 2) a POP
  link. In the first case, you can write a .procmailrc file, while in
  the second there are tools for checking the mail prior to fetching it.

  A very simple .procmailrc that defines a few rules:



       # $HOME/.procmailrc

       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail # make sure it exists

       # Store messages directed to the "foo" mailing list to $HOME/mail/foo
       :0
       * ^To:.*foo
       foo

       # Discard messages that are not explicitly sent to me or to one of the
       # mailling lists I subscribed to.
       :0
       * !^TO(guido|jed|lugvr|ldp|nobody)
       /dev/null

       # ditto, for messages larger than 50k.
       :0
       * > 50000
       /dev/null



  man procmailex for further examples.

  POP users will want to use poppy, a useful Perl script for checking
  the mail before fetching it. Get it from
  <ftp://metalab.unc.edu/system/mail/pop>.



  4.14.  X Window System (XFree86)



  4.14.1.  Setting Up the X Server


  Come on, it's no longer as difficult as it used to be... All major
  distributions include a tool for setting up X11 (e.g.  XConfigurator,
  sax, XF86Setup, or at least xf86config). X configuration is virtually
  automatic these days, but a few video cards may cause a headache.

  First of all, check out at the XFree86 site (
  <http://www.xfree86.org>) whether your video card is supported.  If
  so, then try this procedure:


  ·  install the plain VGA server;

  ·  go to <ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current/binaries>, cd to
     the proper Linux subdirectory, and download the archives
     X_version_bin.tgz, X_version_set.tgz, and all the servers.  Amongst
     other programs, the first archive contains the most up-to-date
     SuperProbe;

  ·  unpack X_version_bin.tgz to a temporary directory, cd to it, and
     run ./SuperProbe. If your video card is recognised, chances are
     that you'll be able to set it up. Otherwise, hard luck;

  ·  install the servers and X_version_set.tgz from /usr/X11R6/, then
     run  XF86Setup.

  This has always worked for me, but your mileage may vary. Please note
  that most times X11 won't start because you chose wrong specs for your
  monitor!  Start with conservative settings, i.e. 800x600 and 256
  colours, then pump it up. Warning: these operations are dangerous and
  your monitor might be damaged!

  If your card isn't supported, you can either: 1) wait for the next
  version of XFree86; 2) buy a commercial X server; 3) buy a supported
  video card.  Quartum non datur.



  4.14.2.  Keypad


  We have seen above how to make a few special keys work. The sample
  file .Xmodmap works well if you want to use Xjed, but it makes the
  keypad unusable. You'll then need another config file, which we'll
  call .Xmodmap.num:



       ! Definitions can be found in <X11/keysymdef.h>

       keycode 77  = Num_Lock
       keycode 112 = KP_Divide
       keycode 63  = KP_Multiply
       keycode 82  = KP_Subtract
       keycode 86  = KP_Add
       keycode 79  = KP_7
       keycode 80  = KP_8
       keycode 81  = KP_9
       keycode 83  = KP_4
       keycode 84  = KP_5
       keycode 85  = KP_6
       keycode 87  = KP_1
       keycode 88  = KP_2
       keycode 89  = KP_3
       keycode 90  = KP_0
       keycode 91  = KP_Decimal



  Make sure that your /etc/X11/XF86Config does not contain these three
  lines:



         ServerNumLock
         Xleds
         XkbDisable



  and in case, comment them out. To re-enable the keypad, you'll issue
  the command xmodmap .Xmodmap.num.



  4.14.3.  Graphical Login with xdm


  To be greeted by a graphical login, edit the file /etc/inittab, which
  should include a line like this:



       x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon # also kdm or gdm



  where 5 is the runlevel corresponding to X11. Modify the line that
  defines the default runlevel (usually 2 or 3), changing it as above:



       id:5:initdefault:



  The number of colours is specified in /etc/X11/xdm/Xserver:



       :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 -bpp 16 vt07  # first X server, 65k colours
       :1 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :1 -bpp 32 vt08  # second X server, true colour



  If you already have .xinitrc, copy it to .xsession and make the latter
  executable with chmod +x .xsession. Now issue the command telinit 5
  and you're in business.



  4.14.4.  Window Manager


  Once X works, there are endless possibilities of configuration; it
  depends on the window manager you use, there are tens to choose from.
  Mostly, it's all down to editing one or more ASCII files in your home
  directory; in other cases you don't have to edit a thing, and use an
  applet or even a menu.

  Some examples:


  ·  the fvwm family: copy /etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc (or similar) to
     your home using the appropriate name, browse it and start
     experimenting. You may waste a lot of time before you get the
     precise look and feel you like;

  ·  WindowMaker: it has several config files that live under
     $HOME/GNUstep, and a cool configuration applet;

  ·  KDE, Gnome, xfce and others: nothing to edit manually here,
     everything can be done via the menu.
  In short: if you don't mind editing config file, choose something like
  icewm, fvwm*, blackbox etc; if you do mind, the choice is currently
  restricted to KDE, Gnome, WindowMaker, and Xfce. Email me if I'm
  wrong.

  It's important to have a good .xinitrc. An example:



       #!/bin/sh
       # $HOME/.xinitrc

       usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
       xmodmap $usermodmap

       xset s noblank  # turn off the screen saver
       xset s 300 2    # screen saver start after 5 min
       xset m 10 5     # set mouse acceleration

       rxvt -cr green -ls -bg black -fg white -fn 7x14 \
         -geometry 80x30+57+0 &

       if [ "$1" = "" ] ; then  # default
         WINMGR=wmaker
       else
         WINMGR=$1
       fi

       $WINMGR



  Although it doesn't appear to be strictly required, make it executable
  with chmod +x .xinitrc.

  The .xinitrc above lets you choose the window manager: try


       $ startx startkde # or other w.m.



  4.14.5.  Defaults for X11 Apps


  Find out where the app-defaults directory is (it should be
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults). Several apps keep a configuration
  file there.



  4.14.6.  Adding Fonts


  Recent versions of XFree86 (say, > 3.3.4) use an X Font Server that
  supports PostScript Type 1 and True Type fonts natively, so you can
  use the wealth of fonts available on the net. There's a simple
  procedure to follow.

  Suppose that you download a Type 1 font collection, e.g. Freefont (
  <ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/freefonts-0.10.tar.gz>).  To make
  it visible to the font server, unpack the archive from
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/. Then edit /etc/X11/fs/config, add an entry
  for the new directory, and restart the font server.

  If you're rolling your own font collection, you'll need to supply the
  files fonts.dir and fonts.scale; the tool to make them is type1inst,
  available from
  <http://http://goblet.anu.edu.au/~m9305357/type1inst.html>.

  As for the True Type fonts, group them in a directory of your choice
  and create fonts.dir using ttmkfdir > fonts.dir, included in the
  Freetype archive;  <http://www.freetype.org>. Then proceed as above.
  For example, if you want to use the Windows fonts you have in, say,
  /mnt/win/windows/fonts, go to that directory, run ttmkfdir, edit
  /etc/X11/fs/config and restart the font server.

  It all started from the original True Type X font server:
  <http://http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/programs/xfsft/>.



  4.15.  Users' Configurations


  When you're done editing the dot files, copy them to /etc/skel as seen
  in Section ``Software Configuration''.



  4.16.  Making .rpms


  rpm is such a wonderful method of keeping packages under control that
  I'm reluctant to install .tar.gz archives but in very few special
  cases (e.g., security). Whenever you install a tarball, consider
  turning it into an .rpm archive, then reinstall it; consult the RPM
  HOWTO. Also, if you use recent gcc versions, it may be advisable to
  put this in your /etc/rpmrc:



       optflags: i386 -O2 -mpentiumpro



  4.17.  Upgrading


  If you upgrade your machine, do your backup as usual and remember to
  save a few additional files. Some could be /etc/X11/XF86Config,
  /usr/bin/fax, all the stuff in /usr/local, the kernel configuration,
  the whole /etc, and all the mail in /var/spool/mail.

  Then it's time to upgrade (in rare cases, downgrade!) applications
  that your distribution ship with, and to add additional packages. Keep
  a list of these ones.



  5.  Configuration Software + Docs


  There are several programs that make Linux easy to setup and
  configure. Some are becoming sort of standard: Red Hat, Caldera and
  other distributions ship with apps like setup, printtool, netcfg,
  usertool, etc, while S.u.S.E. ships with a comprehensive configuration
  program called Yast. Other useful programs are:


  ·  The Dotfile Generator: fine X app with modules to configure
     packages like emacs, bash, procmail and more. Its page is at
     <http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile>;

  ·  Linuxconf: the ultimate configuration tool. It can do everything,
     both in console and under X. Go to
     <http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf> at once.

  Documents on Linux configuration are popping up everywhere. One of the
  most complete is TrinityOS,
  <http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html>. Bug the
  author to have him turn the document in nicer formats.

  A jolly good page is  <http://dotfiles.com>. Just what it says - a
  collection of configuration files.

  6.2.  Feedback


  Perhaps even more than other HOWTOs, this one needs and welcomes your
  suggestions, criticisms, and contributions. Not only is feedback
  welcome: it's necessary. If you think something is missing or wrong,
  please email me.  If you have a distribution other than Red
  Hat/Mandrake and your config files are different or placed in other
  directories, please tell me and I'll include your tips. My aim is
  making life with Linux as easy as possible.

  Linux has a huge number of packages, so it's impossible to include
  directions for all of them. Please keep your requests/suggestions
  pertinent to the ``most reasonable'' programs---I'll leave it to your
  common sense.

  Many thanks to all other HOWTO authors and man pages
  writers/maintainers, whose work I've shamelessly pilfered; and to all

  I hope you'll find this work useful, though. Whenever I install a new
  Linux box, I actually do...
