  1.  Introduction

  Quake, QuakeWorld and Quake II are tremendously popular 3D action
  games developed by id Software.

  If you're not familiar with the Quake games, there are better places
  than this HOWTO to learn about the basics.  See section ``Other
  Sources of Information'' below for a list of some of these better
  places.

  This document assumes you have Linux up and running, and in some cases
  the X Window System as well.  X is not required to run these games,
  but it's a nice way to test a basic installation. If you are not
  running X, you may safely skip over any references to it.

  Sections of this document that were updated in the last revision have
  a ** after the section heading.  Sections updated in the revision
  prior to the last are marked with a ++.



  1.1.  Feedback,Comments, Corrections

  This document certainly does not contain everything there is to know
  about Linux Quake.  With your help, though, we can bring it closer to
  that ideal.  We want this HOWTO to be as complete and accurate as
  possible, so if you notice mistakes or omissions, please bring them to
  our attention.

  Questions, comments, or corrections should be sent to Bob Zimbinski
  (bobz@mr.net) or Mike Hallock (mikeh@medina.net).  Constructive
  criticism is welcome.  Flames are not.

  2.  Quake/Quakeworld

  To install Quake on your Linux system, you'll need some flavor of the
  official Quake distribution from id.  This will be either the retail
  DOS/Windows CD-ROM that you bought at your favorite software store, or
  the shareware version you downloaded from the net (see ``below'' for
  details on acquiring the shareware version).   Alternatively, if
  you've already got Quake installed on a DOS/Windows machine, you can
  use the relevant files from that installation.


  2.1.  Minimum Requirements

  You will need, as a bare minimum, the following:


  o  A Pentium 90 or better (133 recommended) computer

  o  16 MB RAM (24 recommended)

  o  The Quake CD-ROM or the shareware version (quake106.zip)

  o  Linux kernel version 2.0.24 or later

  o  libc 5.2.18 or later

  o  One of the following:

  o  X11R5 or later (for xquake)

  o  SVGAlib 1.2.0 or later (for squake and glquake)

  o  30-80 megabytes free disk space (depends on how you install)

  o  Access to the root account of the machine you're installing on


  Optional:

  o  A supported soundcard

  o  A 3Dfx VooDoo Graphics or VooDoo2 3D graphics accelerator card.

  o  Mesa 2.6 or later (for glquake)


  2.2.  Installing Quake



  2.2.1.  Download the Necessary Files**

  All the necessary files for Linux Quake are available at id Software's
  ftp site, ftp.idsoftware.com.  This site can be quite busy at times,so

  o  Glide runtime libraries http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html

  2.2.2.  Create the Installation Directory ++

  The first thing you'll need to do is decide where you  want to install
  Quake.  Lots of folks like to put it in /usr/games/quake.  Anal system
  administrator that I am, I choose to install anything that's not part
  of my Linux distribution under /usr/local.  So for me, Quake goes in
  /usr/local/games/quake.  If you choose to install somewhere else,
  please substitute the appropriate path wherever /usr/local/games/quake
  is mentioned.

  Note to Redhat users:  If you plan on installing QuakeWorld from the
  rpm packages, you should probably install Quake in
  /usr/local/games/quake, since the rpms install to this directory by
  default.

  So go ahead and create the directory you'll install Quake in, and cd
  to it.  The rest of these instructions will assume that this is your
  current directory.



            mkdir /usr/local/games/quake
            cd /usr/local/games/quake



  2.2.3.  Installing From a Quake CD ++

  If you're installing from a Quake CD-ROM, read on.  Otherwise you have
  permission to skip this section.

  There are at least two versions of the Quake CD in circulation.  I've
  got one from the early days that has Quake version 1.01 on it.  Iv'e
  seen other CDs that contain version 1.06.  You have 1.01 if you see
  files on your CD called quake101.1 and quake101.2.  If instead you see
  a file called resource.1, you have a newer CD.  Mount your Quake CD
  now and determine which version you've got.  In the example below,
  replace /dev/cdrom and /mnt/cdrom with the device file and mount point
  appropriate for your sysem:



            mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
            ls /mnt/cdrom



  o  If you have a resource.1 file on your CD, you can skip ahead to the
     next bullet.  For a version 1.01 CD, you'll need to download the
     Quake shareware package to update the .pak files after the
     installation.  The last bullet in this section explains this.


  o  Concatenate the two resource files from your CD to a single file on
     your hard disk:


            cat /mnt/cdrom/quake101.1 /mnt/cdrom/quake101.2 > resource.1


  o  Now continue on to the next paragraph, but when I refer to
     /mnt/cdrom/resource.1, you should use
     /usr/local/games/quake/resource.1 instead.



  o  Now it's time to extract the Quake files.  The resource.1 file on
     your CD is really an lha archive (lha is a file compression and
     archiving format like zip or tar).  We'll use the lha(1) command to
     extract it.  If lha is not already installed on your system, you
     can get it from
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/compress/lha-1.00.tar.Z.



            lha e /mnt/cdrom/resource.1



  When lha is done, your Quake directory will contain a bunch of new
  files.  A directory called id1/ will also be created.  The files in
  this directory are the only ones that are important for Linux Quake,
  so you can safely remove everything else.  If you're totally new to
  Quake, or even if you're not, you may want to hang on to the *.txt
  files.  On my system, I throw all the readmes that accumulate into a
  doc/ directory.  So:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            mkdir doc
            mv *.txt doc
            rm -f *



  o  If you installed from a version 1.01 CD, now you need to overwrite
     your id1/pak0.pak file with the one from the Quake shareware
     version.  Install the shareware version as described in ``Shareware
     Version Install'', only install it in some temporary directory so
     you don't overwrite your real Quake files.  When you've extracted
     all the shareware files, copy the id1/pak0.pak file from the
     temporary shareware directory to your /usr/local/games/quake/id1
     directory.  After that, you can erase the temporary shareware
     files.

  That's it for installing from the CD.  You can jump ahead to section
  "``Installing the Linux Binaries''" now.


  2.2.4.  DOS/Windows to Linux Install

  If you have Quake installed under Windows or DOS on a different
  machine, you can transfer the files in quake\id1\ to your Linux system
  via FTP or some other mechanism.  Keep in mind that the filenames on
  your Linux system must be in lower case for Quake to find them, so you
  may have to rename them after the transfer.  Also note that it may be
  necessary to delete your DOS/Win installation after you do this to
  remain in compliance with the terms of id's software license.  It's
  not my fault if you do something illegal.

  If your DOS/Win and Linux systems are on the same machine, you have
  two options: copy the files from your DOS/Windows partition to your
  Linux partition, or link to the necessary files from Linux.  Both
  options will work equally well.  You just save around 50 megabytes of
  disk space when you link instead of copy.

  Whatever you choose to do, start by cd'ing to your Quake directory and
  creating a new directory below it called id1:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            mkdir id1



  o  If you want to copy the files from your DOS/Windows partition, do
     something like this:



            cp /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak id1



  o  To create links to your DOS/Windows Quake files instead, do this:



            cd id1
            ln -s /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak .



  Replace /win95/games/quake with the correct path to your DOS/Windows
  partition and Quake installation directory.

  The Quake data files are now installed.  Move ahead to "``Installing
  the Linux Binaries''".


  2.2.5.  Shareware Version Install

  The single-episode shareware version of Quake is freely available for
  download from id's ftp site.  It has all the features of the full
  version, with a couple of major limitations:  You can't play
  QuakeWorld with it, and you can't play custom or modified levels.

  Installing the shareware version of Quake isn't really much different
  than installing from the CD.

  See section ``Download the Necessary Files'' for the location of the
  shareware distribution.  Download it and extract it to your Quake
  directory:


            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            unzip -L /wherever/you/put/it/quake106.zip



  Now you've got (among others) a file called resource.1 that's really
  an lha archive (lha is a file compression and archiving format like
  zip or tar).  We'll use the lha(1) command to extract it.  If lha is
  not already installed on your system, you can get it from
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/compress/lha-1.00.tar.Z.



            lha e resource.1



  When lha is done, your Quake directory will contain a bunch of new
  files.  A directory called id1/ will also be created.  The files in
  this directory are the only ones that are important for Linux Quake,
  so you can safely remove everything else.  If you're totally new to
  Quake, or even if you're not, you may want to hang on to the *.txt
  files.  On my system, I throw all the readmes that accumulate into a
  doc/ subdirectory.  So:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            mkdir doc
            mv *.txt doc
            rm -f *



  Now you're ready to install the Linux binaries.


  2.3.  Adding the Linux Binaries

  Decide which of the three flavors of Quake you'd like to install:

  o  X11 Quake allows you to run Quake in a window on your X desktop.
     It's the least exciting client, but it's a great, safe way to test
     your installation.

  o  Squake is the SVGAlib Quake client.  It runs full screen on your
     console.

  o  GLQuake is the OpenGL Quake client, the One True Way to play Quake
     if you have a 3Dfx accellerator card.

  Download the packages you want (see section ``Download the Necessary
  Files'') and extract them to your Quake directory like so:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            tar -xzf XXXX-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz


  2.4.  Setting Permissions

  Quake and QuakeWorld servers can be run by any user.  The Quake
  clients, however,  need access to your sound and graphics cards, which
  requires privileges that normal users don't have.  One (bad) way to
  deal with this is to always run Quake as root.  Responsible system
  administrators will cringe at this filthy suggestion.  Making the
  Quake binaries setuid root is a more acceptable solution.  Quake can
  then be run by regular users and still have the privileges it needs to
  access the sound and graphics devices.  Setuid presents a security
  risk, though.  A clever user could exploit a bug or security hole in
  Quake to gain root access to your system.  Of course, if you don't run
  a multi-user system, this is may not be a big concern.

  squake is the only Quake client that must be run with root
  permissions.  With a little work, you can run the X and GL clients
  without setuid.  ``Running X and GL games without setuid'' in the Tips
  and Tricks section tells how to make this work.

  If you plan to run squake, make it setuid root with the following
  commands:


            chown root squake
            chmod 4755 squake



  If you've decided it's ok to run quake.x11 and glquake setuid root on
  your system, you can repeat the above commands for these binaries as
  well.



  2.5.  X11 Quake

  If you installed the X11 client, now's a good time to try it out.  You
  may need to do further configuration for glquake and squake, but at
  this point quake.x11 should be ready to go.



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            ./quake.x11



  If all is well, a small Quake window should appear with the first demo
  running in it.  You should hear sound effects and possibly music, if
  the CD is mounted.  If any of this fails to occur, please see the
  ``Troubleshooting'' section for help.


  2.6.  SVGAlib Quake

  Both squake and glquake require SVGAlib to run (glquake uses SVGAlib
  to process keyboard and mouse input, in case you're wondering).
  SVGAlib comes with most modern Linux distributions, and must be
  properly configured before squake or glquake will run correctly.

  libvga.config is SVGAlib's configuration file.  On most systems you'll
  find it in either /etc or /etc/vga.  Make sure the mouse, monitor, and
  video card settings in this file are correct for your system.  See the
  SVGAlib documentation for more details.

  If you don't already have SVGAlib on your system, download it from the
  location mentioned in ``the files section'' above.  If you have a
  RedHat 5.x or other glibc-based Linux distribution, see ``Glibc,
  RedHat 5.x, Debian 2 considerations'' in the Troubleshooting/FAQs
  section for important information about compiling libraries for use
  with Quake. A precompiled libc5 SVGAlib binary is available at
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/svgalib-1.3.0.libc5.bin.tar.gz
  for those who don't want to deal with the hassle of compiling for
  libc5.

  You should run squake from a virtual console.  It won't run from X
  unless you're root when you start it.  And running a game as the root
  user is something that should be avoided.  So if you're in X, do a
  CTRL+ALT+F1, login and then:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            ./squake



  ``Running SVGA and GL games from X'' in the Tips & Tricks section
  below explains how to launch SVGA and GL Quake from X without manually
  switching to a virtual console.


  2.7.  GLQuake

  Hardware-accelerated OpenGL Quake is Quake the way God intended it to
  be.  There is no substitute, and once you've experienced it there's no
  going back.

  To run glquake, you need a 3D card with the Voodoo, Voodoo2 or Voodoo
  Rush graphics chipset on it.  There are specific issues to be dealt
  with if you have a Voodoo Rush card, and I won't go into them now
  because frankly, I wouldn't know what I was talking about.  A future
  version of this HOWTO will cover Rush issues (If somebody wants to
  write about Voodoo Rush issues, I'll gladly include it here).

  The SVGAlib, Glide, and Mesa libraries must all be installed and
  configured properly on your system for glquake to work.  The following
  sections will very briefly cover what you need to do to get them
  going.

  Bernd Kreimeier's (bk@gamers.org) Linux 3Dfx HOWTO
  (http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/xf3D/howto/3Dfx-HOWTO.html) is good
  source for further information.

  The 3dfx.glide.linux newsgroup on the 3dfx news server (news.3dfx.com)
  is another good source of information about the intersection of Linux,
  glide, Mesa and Quake.


  2.7.1.  SVGAlib

  glquake uses SVGAlib to get input from the mouse and keyboard, so
  you'll need to configure it as outlined in section ``SVGAlib Quake''.



  2.7.2.  Glide

  Glide is a library that provides an API for programming 3Dfx based
  cards.  If you want the Mesa graphics library to use your 3Dfx card,
  you've gotta have it.

  The latest version of glide can always be found at
  http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html.  Select the package(s)
  appropriate for your system, and install according to the instructions
  on the web page.

  Note that unless you download the 3Dfx device driver package in
  addition to the Glide library, you will only be able to run Glide
  applications (like GLQuake) as root.  Install the /dev/3dfx module and
  you can play GLQuake as a regular user.

  Once you have glide installed, try out the test program that comes
  with it.  Remember this program:  it's a good way to reset your
  display if you ever have a glide application (like GLQuake) crash and
  leave your screen switched off.  NOTE: run this test from a VC, not X!
  It's possible for the test app to lose mouse and keyboard focus in X,
  and then you'll have no way of shutting it down.



            /usr/local/glide/bin/test3Dfx



  Your screen should turn blue and prompt you to hit any key.  After you
  press a key you should be returned to the prompt.  3dfx.glide.linux on
  3dfx's news server (news.3dfx.com) is a great source of information
  for Linux glide-specific problems.


  2.7.3.  Mesa

  Once glide's installed, you need to install Mesa, a free OpenGL
  implementation by Brian Paul (brianp@elastic.avid.com).  Luckily, you
  won't have to look far, because Mesa 2.6 is included with the QLQuake
  & QuakeWorld binaries.  All you have to do is move it to the right
  place:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            cp libMesaGL.so.2.6 /usr/local/lib
            ldconfig



  If you want to upgrade Mesa to a more recent version (Mesa 3.0 is the
  most recent version as of this writing), you can download the latest
  from  ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa If you have a RedHat 5.x or
  other glibc-based Linux distribution, see ``Glibc, RedHat 5.x, Debian
  2 considerations'' in the Troubleshooting/FAQs section for important
  information about compiling libraries for Quake.

  After you've built it according to the instructions, you will have to
  do two things:

  o  Remove your old Mesa installation.  If you previously installed a
     libMesaGL.so.2.6 as described above, you must remove it or Quake
     may not use the new version.



            cd /usr/local/lib/
            rm -f libMesaGL.so.2*



  o  If the new Mesa has a major version number that's greater than 2,
     you need to create a link to it with the name libMesaGL.so.2:



            cd /usr/local/lib/
            ln -s /wherever/you/installed/it/libMesaGL.so.3.0 libMesaGL.so.2
            ldconfig



  Now switch to a VC (CTRL+ALT+F1)  and start glquake.



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            ./glquake



  2.8.  Linux-Specific Command Line Options

  This section covers command line options that are specific to the
  Linux versions of Quake.  There are plenty of other Quake options, but
  they're beyond the scope of this HOWTO.  Check out some of the sites
  listed in section ``General Quake Information'' for this kind of
  information.


     -mem num
        Specify memory in megabytes to allocate (default is 8MB, which
        should be fine for most needs).


     -nostdout
        Don't do any output to stdout.  Use this if you don't want all
        the console output dumped to your terminal.


     -mdev device
        Mouse device, default is /dev/mouse


     -mrate speed
        Mouse baud rate, default is 1200
     -cddev device
        CD device, default is /dev/cdrom


     -mode num
        Use indicated video mode (squake only)


     -nokdb
        Don't initialize keyboard


     -sndbits 8 or 16
        Set sound bit sample size.  Default is 16 if supported.


     -sndspeed speed
        Set sound speed.  Usual values are 8000, 11025, 22051 and 44100.
        Default is 11025.


     -sndmono
        Set mono sound


     -sndstereo
        Set stereo sound (default if supported)


  2.9.  QuakeWorld **

  http://www.quakeworld.net says it better than I could:


       QuakeWorld is an Internet multi-player specific version of
       Quake.  While the original version of Quake can be played
       over the Internet, modem users - the majority of players,
       had less than satisfactory play. Symptoms like excessive lag
       - actions actually happening much later than you did them;
       packet loss - the game would freeze and resume several sec-
       onds later; and various other difficulties plagued users.
       After realizing how many people played Quake on the inter-
       net, and how many wanted to, but couldn't due to the play
       being unsatisfactory, John Carmack of id Software decided to
       create a version of Quake that was optimized for the average
       modem Internet player. This Internet specific version does
       only 1 thing, play deathmatch games over a TCP/IP network
       such as the Internet. It has no support for solo play, and
       you can't do anything with out connecting to a special
       server.


  You need the full, registered or retail version of Quake to play
  QuakeWorld, and a Linux QuakeWorld client.  QuakeWorld clients come in
  the same flavors (X11, SVGAlib and Mesa) as normal Quake, but they're
  all bundled together in one package, so you only need to download one
  file.  However, you've got four packages to choose from:

  o  a libc5 tar.gz package

  o  a glibc tar.gz package

  o  a libc5 rpm package

  o  a glibc rpm package

  Install just one of these packages.  Each contains the same files,
  they're just linked against different libraries.  Redhat 5.x users
  should choose the the glibc rpm package.  Users of glibc based systems
  without rpm support should use the glibc tar package.  The libc5 rpm
  is for Redhat distributions prior to 5.0 and other distributions that
  use the rpm package format.  The libc5 tar.gz package is for Slackware
  and everyone else.

  See the ``Download the Necessary Files'' section for the location of
  the Linux Quakeworld files.

  The prerequisites and configuration for these binaries are the same as
  for Quake, so refer to the previous sections for help on setting up
  SVGAlib or glide/Mesa.


  2.9.1.  Installing the RPM packages ++

  Installation of the rpm packages should be as simple as:



            su root
            rpm -Uvh qwcl-xxxxx.i386.rpm



  qwcl, glqwcl and glqwcl.glx will be installed setuid root so that they
  can access the graphics devices on your system.  The X and GL clients
  can be run without root privileges if you follow the instructions in
  ``Running X and GL games without      setuid'' below.

  Rpm may complain that it can't find libglide2x.so.  The Glide library
  is only necessary if you have a 3Dfx card and want to run QuakeWorld
  in GL mode (glqwcl).  If you don't plan to use the GL mode, you can
  override the glide dependency with the --nodeps option:



            su root
            rpm -Uvh qwcl-xxxxx.i386.rpm --nodeps



  2.9.2.  Installing the tar.gz packages ++

  To install, just untar the file in your Quake directory.  Do it as
  root so the proper file permissions get set:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            su root
            tar -xzf qwcl2.21-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz



  qwcl, glqwcl and glqwcl.glx will be installed setuid root so that they
  can access the graphics devices on your system.  The GL and X clients
  can be run without root privileges if you follow the instructions in
  ``Running X and GL games without      setuid'' below.


  2.9.3.  Running QuakeWorld ++

  Once QuakeWorld is installed alongside your Quake files, you can start
  it up like:


            ./qwcl +connect some.server.address



  See section ``Related Software'' for info about some nifty front ends
  for QuakeWorld that make finding servers easy.


  o  lib3dfxgl.so  **

     With Quakeworld version 2.30, an alternative to the Mesa library is
     available.  lib3dfxgl.so is a mini-GL driver optimized for Quake
     that provides slightly better framerates than Mesa.  This is a port
     of a driver that 3Dfx developed for Quake under Windows, and
     apparently not all of its features work properly yet.  So hopefully
     we can expect its performance to improve with time.

     Like Mesa, lib3dfxgl.so requires Glide in order to access your 3Dfx
     card.  The Quakeworld packages come with a script, glqwcl.3dfxgl
     for running Quakeworld with this library on glibc systems.  The
     next paragraph explains how to run Quakeworld with lib3dfxgl.so on
     a libc5 system.  On a glibc system in order for this script to
     work,the glqwcl executable must not be setuid, nor should you run
     it as root.  glqwcl will silently load Mesa rather than
     lib3dfxgl.so if it runs with root permissions.  This non-root
     requirement implies that you have the /dev/3dfx driver installed.

     On a libc5 system, you need to create a symbolic link to
     lib3dfxgl.so called libMesaGL.so.2 like so:


            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            ln -sf lib3dfxgl.so libMesaGL.so.2



  Then start Quakeworld from a script that tells $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
  look in the current directory:

  ______________________________________________________________________
       #!/bin/sh

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./glqwcl $*

  ______________________________________________________________________



  You can tell which driver is being loaded by looking for output like
  the following in your console as Quakeworld starts:


       GL_VENDOR: 3Dfx Interactive Inc.
       GL_RENDERER: 3Dfx Interactive Voodoo^2(tm)
       GL_VERSION: 1.1
       GL_EXTENSIONS: 3DFX_set_global_palette WGL_EXT_swap_control GL_EXT_paletted_texture GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette GL_SGIS_multitexture



  If GL_VENDOR says Brian Paul rather than 3Dfx Interactive Inc., that
  means Mesa is still being used rather than the miniport dirver.


  o  glqwcl.glx **


     glqwcl.glx is linked against standard OpenGL libraries instead of
     Mesa.  This allows Quakeworld to run on other 3D hardware that is
     supported by other OpenGL implementations.  At this time, I dont'
     know of any OpenGL implementations that support hardware other than
     3Dfx, but this renderer ensures that when they appear, we'll be
     able to play Quakeworld with them.

     This is a GLX application, and as such, must be run from X.

     You can use this client with Mesa/3Dfx if you install Mesa and
     Glide as explained in the previous section, then set the
     $MESA_GLX_FX environment variable to "fullscreen" before you run
     quake2:



            export MESA_GLX_FX=fullscreen
            ./glqwcl.glx +_windowed_mouse 1



  Why the +_windowed_mouse 1 option?  Remember that this is an X
  application which happens to use your 3Dfx card.  Even though the
  display takes up your entire screen, Quakeworld is stil running in a
  window.  This means that if you're not very careful, you could move
  the mouse pointer outside the Quakeworld window, and Quakeworld will
  suddenly stop responding to mouse and keyboard input.
  +_windowed_mouse 1 avoids this problem by telling glqwcl.glx to grab
  the mouse and not let it move outside its window.



  2.10.  Servers

  Most, if not all, existing information about running a DOS/Windows QW
  server is equally applicable to running a Linux server.

  To start a QuakeWorld server, simply do:



            ./qwsv



  The official QuakeWorld server manual lives at
  http://qwcentral.stomped.com.


  2.11.  Mods & Addons

  One of the very cool things about the Quake games is that the authors
  made them easily extensible.  End users can create their own levels,
  add new weapons or monsters, or even completely change the rules of
  the game.


  2.11.1.  Capture the Flag

  This is my favorite variation of both Quake and Quake 2.  Instead of
  just running around and killing everyone you meet (which definitely
  has its merits, don't get me wrong!), CTF is team-based and more
  strategic.  Dave 'Zoid' Kirsch, also the maintainer of the Linux Quake
  ports, created this mod.

  Everything you need to know about CTF can be found at
  http://captured.com/threewave/  You need
  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/planetquake/threewave/ctf/client/3wctfc.zip
  to play.  To install the client piece of CTF, simply create a
  directory called ctf in your Quake directory and unzip the 3wctfc.zip
  file there.  The accompanying readme.txt file is chock full of good
  information.



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            mkdir ctf
            cd ctf
            unzip -L /wherever/you/put/it/3wctfc.zip



  For information on running a CTF server, see the web pages mentioned
  above.


  2.11.2.  Mission Packs **

  Activision released two add-on packs of extra levels for Quake,
  Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity.


  o  Mission Pack 1: The Scourge of Armagon Assuming your CD is mounted
     on /mnt/cdrom and Quake is installed in /usr/local/games/quake:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake
            mkdir hipnotic
            cp /mnt/cdrom/hipnotic/pak0.pak hipnotic
            cp /mnt/cdrom/hipnotic/config.cfg hipnotic



  Play the mission pack like this:

       cd /usr/local/games/quake
       ./quake.x11 -game hipnotic



  o  Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity Installing the second
     mission pack is pretty much the same procedure as installing the
     first.  Follow the directions for Mission Pack 1, but replace the
     word hipnotic with the word rogue, and skip the config.cfg step, as
     this file isn't included on the Mission Pack 2 CD.


  2.11.3.  Quake Tools

  Anybody care to contribute some info about qcc, bsp and all that?



  3.  Quake II

  To install Quake II on your Linux system, you'll need some flavor of
  the official Quake II distribution from id.  This will be either the
  retail Windows CD-ROM that you bought at your favorite software store,
  or the demo version you downloaded from the net.  See ``Download the
  Necessary Files'' for details on acquiring the demo version.
  Alternatively, if you've already got Quake installed on a Windows
  machine, you can use the relevant files from that installation.


  3.1.  Prerequisites

  You will need, as a bare minimum, the following:


  o  A Pentium 90 or better (133 recommended) computer

  o  16 MB RAM (24 recommended)

  o  The Quake 2 CD-ROM or the demo version (q2-314-demo-x86.exe)

  o  Linux kernel version 2.0.24 or later

  o  libc 5.2.18 or later

  o  One of the following:

  o  X11 server that supports the MITSM shared memory extension. 8 and
     16 bit displays are supported.   (for X renderer)

  o  SVGAlib 1.2.10 or later (for SVGA and GL renderer)

  o  25-400 megabytes free disk space (depending on how you install)

  o  Access to the root account of the machine you're installing on


  Optional:

  o  A supported soundcard

  o  A 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics or Voodoo2 or Voodoo Rush 3D graphics
     accelerator card.

  o  3Dfx glide libraries installed (for GL renderer)

  o  Mesa 2.6 or later (for GL renderer)


  3.2.  Installing Quake II



  3.2.1.  Download the Necessary Files**

  All the necessary files for Linux Quake II are available at id
  Software's ftp site, ftp.idsoftware.com.  This site can be quite busy
  at times,so you may want to use one of these mirror sites instead:

  o  ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff (California, USA)

  o  ftp.gamesnet.net/idsoftware (California, USA)

  o  ftp.stomped.com/pub/mirror/idstuff (Minnesota, USA)

  o  mirrors.telepac.pt/pub/idgames (Lisbon, Portugal)

  o  download.netvision.net.il/pub/mirrors/idsoftware (Haifa, Israel)

  The Quake II files mentioned in in this section are:

  o  Mesa 3D graphics library http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html


  o  unzip archive utility
     http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/compress/unzip-5.31.tar.gz


  3.2.2.  Create the Installation Directory

  The first thing you'll need to do is decide where you  want to install
  Quake II.  Lots of folks like to put it in /usr/games/quake.  Anal
  system administrator that I am, I choose to install anything that's
  not part of my Linux distribution under /usr/local.  So for me, Quake
  II goes in /usr/local/games/quake2.  If you choose to install
  somewhere else, please substitute the appropriate path wherever
  /usr/local/games/quake2 is mentioned.

  So go ahead and create the directory you'll install Quake II in, and
  cd to it.  The rest of these instructions will assume that this is
  your current directory.



            mkdir /usr/local/games/quake2
            cd /usr/local/games/quake2



  3.2.3.  Installing from CD

  Place your Quake II CD in your CD ROM drive, and mount it:



            mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom



  If your CDROM is typically mounted elsewhere, substitute its location
  for /mnt/cdrom.  If you're not sure where your CDROM is mounted,
  please see the documentation for your particular distribution.


  o  Full Install The simplest install method is a "full" install, which
     involves copying the entire contents of your CD to your hard drive.
     This requires about 350 MB, and is accomplished by issuing the
     following commands:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Install/Data/* .



  There'll be a bunch of unnecessary Windows files hanging around that
  you can safely delete:



       rm -f /usr/local/quake2/*.dll
       rm -f /usr/local/quake2/quake2.exe
       rm -f /usr/local/quake2/baseq2/gamex386.dll



  o  Medium Install If 450 MB is too much space for you to devote to
     Quake II, you can skip installing the movie cutscenes and link to
     them on the CD-ROM instead.  This will reduce the space
     requirements to about 200 MB:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            mkdir baseq2
            cp /mnt/cdrom/Install/Data/baseq2/pak0.pak baseq2
            cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Install/Data/baseq2/players baseq2
            ln -s /mnt/cdrom/Install/Data/baseq2/video baseq2/video



  Note that this doesn't mean you have to mount your Quake II CD every
  time to want to play Quake II.  If the game can't load the videos, it
  just won't display them.



  3.2.4.  Windows to Linux install

  If you have Quake II installed under Windows on a different machine,
  you can transfer the files in quake2\baseq2\ to your Linux system via
  FTP or some other mechanism.  Keep in mind that the filenames on your
  Linux system must be in lower case for Quake II to find them, so you
  may have to rename them after the transfer.  Also note that it may be
  necessary to delete your Windows installation after you do this to
  remain in compliance with the terms of id's software license.  It's
  not my fault if you do something illegal.

  If your Windows and Linux systems are on the same machine, you have
  two options: copy the files from your Windows partition to your Linux
  partition, or link to the necessary files from Linux.  Both options
  will work equally well.  You'll just save a lot of disk space when you
  link instead of copy.  As usual, replace /win95/games/quake2 in the
  following examples with the correct path to your Windows partition and
  Quake II installation.


  o  If you want to copy the files from your Windows partition, do
     something like this:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            cp -r /win95/games/quake2/baseq2 .



  o  To create links to your Windows Quake II files instead, do this:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ln -s /win95/games/quake2/baseq2 .



  This second method requires that the Windows partition you're linking
  to be writeable by users, which may not be appropriate for all sys-
  tems.  By making your Windows partition writeable, you are giving all
  users the opportunity to destroy your entire Windows installation.  If
  that's ok with you, modify your /etc/fstab to mount the Windows parti-
  tion with the options umask=002,gid=XXX, where XXX is the group id
  number of the "users" group.  Look in /etc/group for this information.
  When fstab is updated, umount and re-mount the Windows partition and
  you're done.

  You're done installing the Quake II data files.  Move ahead to
  "``Installing the Linux Binaries''".



  3.2.5.  Installing the demo version **

  id Software has a freely available demo version of Quake II at their
  ftp site.  It's a 40 megabyte download.  The demo includes all
  features of the full version, including multiplayer, but it only comes
  with three levels, so it may be difficult to find a server to play on.

  See the section ``Download the      Necessary Files'' above for the
  location of the Quake II demo.  Download it and place it in your Quake
  II directory.

  The demo distribution is a self-extracting zip file (it's self-
  extracting in other OS's anyway).  You can extract it with the
  unzip(1) command, which should be included in most modern
  distributions.  If you don't have unzip, you can download it from the
  location listed in the ``Download the Necessary Files'' section.

  cd to your Quake II directory and extract the archive:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            unzip q2-314-demo-x86.exe



  Now we've got to delete some things and move some other things around:


            rm -rf Splash Setup.exe
            mv Install/Data/baseq2 .
            mv Install/Data/DOCS docs
            rm -rf Install
            rm -f baseq2/gamex86.dll



  The Quake II demo is now installed.  You just need to add the Linux
  binaries.


  3.3.  Adding the Linux Binaries**

  There are four Linux Quake II packages available for download:

  o  a libc5 tar.gz package

  o  a glibc tar.gz package

  o  a libc5 rpm package

  o  a glibc rpm package

  Install just one of these packages.  Each contains the same files,
  they're just linked against different libraries.  Redhat 5.x users
  should choose the the glibc rpm package.  Users of glibc based systems
  without rpm support should use the glibc tar package.  The libc5 rpm
  is for Redhat distributions prior to 5.0 and other distributions that
  use the rpm package format.  The libc5 tar.gz package is for Slackware
  and everyone else.

  See the ``Download the Necessary Files'' section for the location of
  the Linux Quake II files.


  3.3.1.  Installing the RPM packages **

  Installation of the rpm packages should be as simple as:



            su root
            rpm -Uvh quake2-xxxxx.i386.rpm



  Rpm may complain that it can't find libglide2x.so.  The Glide library
  is only necessary if you have a 3Dfx card and want to run Quake II in
  GL mode.  If you don't plan to use the GL mode, you can override the
  glide dependency with the --nodeps option:



            su root
            rpm -Uvh quake2-xxxxx.i386.rpm --nodeps



  3.3.2.  Installing the tar.gz packages **

  To install, just untar the file in your Quake II directory.  Do it as
  root so the proper file permissions get set:



       cd /usr/local/games/quake
       su root
       tar -xzf qwcl2.21-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz



  3.4.  Setting Permissions **

  If you ran rpm or tar as root when installing the Quake II package on
  your system, the file permissions should be properly set already.  The
  quake2 executable was installed setuid root so that it can access the
  graphics devices on your system.  For security, the ref_*.so rendering
  libraries are owned by root and writeable only by him.  If root
  doesn't own the libraries, or they're world writeable, quake2 will
  refuse to run.

  If you plan to only run Quake II with the GL or X renderers, your
  quake2 doesn't need to be setuid root.  See ``Running X and GL games
  without setuid'' in the Tips and Tricks section below for information
  on running Quake II without root permissions.


  3.4.1.  Quake2.conf **


  For security reasons, there is a quake2.conf file, which tells Quake
  II where to find the rendering libraries it needs (ref_*.so).  It
  contains only one line, which should be the path to your Quake II
  installation.  Quake II looks for this file in /etc.  If you installed
  Quake II from an .rpm file, this file was installed for you.  If you
  installed from a .tar package, you need to create it like so:



            su root
            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            pwd > /etc/quake2.conf
            chmod 644 /etc/quake2.conf



  3.5.  The X Renderer

  Quake II should be ready to run under X now.  Give it a try:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ./quake2 +set vid_ref softx



  If all is well, after a pretty significant pause, a small Quake II
  window will appear with the first demo running in it.  You should hear
  sound effects and possibly music, if the CD is mounted.  If any of
  this fails to occur, please see section ``Troubleshooting'' for help.


  3.6.  The SVGAlib Renderer

  You need SVGAlib installed and configured if you're going to use
  either the ref_soft or ref_gl renderers.  (Quake II uses SVGAlib to
  process keyboard and mouse input, in case you're wondering why you'd
  need it for the GL renderer).   SVGAlib comes with most modern
  distributions, and must be properly configured before Quake II will
  run correctly outside of X.

  libvga.config is SVGAlib's configuration file.  On most systems you'll
  find it in either /etc or /etc/vga.  Make sure the mouse, monitor, and
  video card settings in this file are correct for your system.  See the
  SVGAlib documentation for more details.

  If you don't already have SVGAlib on your system, download it from the
  location mentioned in ``the files      section'' above.  If you have a
  RedHat 5.x or other glibc-based Linux distribution, see ``Glibc,
  RedHat 5.x,      Debian 2 considerations'' in the Troubleshooting/FAQs
  section for important information about compiling libraries for Quake
  II.  A precompiled libc5 SVGAlib binary is available at
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/svgalib-1.3.0.libc5.bin.tar.gz
  for those who don't want to deal with the hassle of compiling for
  libc5.

  You should run Quake II from a virtual console when using the ref_soft
  or ref_gl renderers.  It won't run from X unless you're root when you
  start it, and that's not advisable. So if you're in X, do a
  CTRL+ALT+F1, login and then:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ./quake2



  ``Running SVGA and GL games from X'' in the Tips & Tricks section
  below explains how to launch SVGA and GL Quake II from X without
  manually switching to a virtual console.


  3.7.  The OpenGL Renderer

  Hardware-accelerated OpenGL Quake is Quake the way God intended it to
  be.  There is no substitute, and once you've experienced it there's no
  going back.

  To run Quake II in GL mode, you need a 3D card with the Voodoo,
  Voodoo2 or Voodoo Rush graphics chipset on it.  There are specific
  issues to be dealt with if you have a Voodoo Rush card, and I won't go
  into them now because frankly, I wouldn't know what I was talking
  about.  A future version of this HOWTO will cover Rush issues (If
  somebody wants to write about Voodoo Rush issues, I'll gladly include
  it here).

  The SVGAlib, Glide, and Mesa libraries must all be installed and
  configured properly on your system for quake2 to work.  The following
  sections will very briefly cover what you need to do to get them
  going.

  Bernd Kreimeier's (bk@gamers.org) Linux 3Dfx HOWTO
  (http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/xf3D/howto/3Dfx-HOWTO.html) is good
  source for further information.

  The 3dfx.glide.linux newsgroup on the 3dfx news server (news.3dfx.com)
  is another good source of information about the intersection of Linux,
  glide, Mesa and Quake.



  3.7.1.  SVGAlib

  Quake II uses SVGAlib to get input from the mouse and keyboard, so
  you'll need to configure it as outlined in section ``SVGAlib
  Renderer'' section.


  3.7.2.  Glide

  Glide is a library that provides an API for programming 3Dfx based
  cards.  If you want the Mesa graphics library to use your 3Dfx card,
  you've gotta have it.

  The latest version of glide can always be found at
  http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html.  Select the package(s)
  appropriate for your system, and install according to the instructions
  on the web page.

  Note that unless you download the 3Dfx device driver package in
  addition to the Glide library, you will only be able to run Glide
  applications (like GLQuake) as root.  Install the /dev/3dfx module and
  you can play GLQuake as a regular user.

  Once you have glide installed, try out the test program that comes
  with it.  Remember this program:  it's a good way to reset your
  display if you ever have a glide application (like GLQuake) crash and
  leave your screen switched off.  NOTE: run this test from a VC, not X!
  It's possible for the test app to lose mouse and keyboard focus in X,
  and then you'll have no way of shutting it down.



            /usr/local/glide/bin/test3Dfx



  Your screen should turn blue and prompt you to hit any key.  After you
  press a key you should be returned to the prompt.  3dfx.glide.linux on
  3dfx's news server (news.3dfx.com) is a great source of information
  for Linux glide-specific problems.


  3.7.3.  Mesa

  Once glide's installed, you need to install Mesa, a free OpenGL
  implementation by Brian Paul (brianp@elastic.avid.com).  Luckily, you
  won't have to look far, because Mesa 2.6 is included with the Quake II
  binaries.  All you have to do is move it to the right place:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            cp libMesaGL.so.2.6 /usr/local/lib
            ldconfig



  If you want to upgrade Mesa to a more recent version (Mesa 3.0 is the
  most recent version as of this writing), you can download the latest
  from  ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa If you have a RedHat 5.x or
  other glibc-based Linux distribution, see ``Glibc, RedHat 5.x, Debian
  2 considerations'' in the Troubleshooting/FAQs section for important
  information about compiling libraries for Quake.

  After you've built it according to the instructions, you will have to
  do two things:


  o  Remove your old Mesa installation.  If you previously installed a
     libMesaGL.so.2.6 as described above, you must remove it or Quake II
     may not use the new version.



            cd /usr/local/lib/
            rm -f libMesaGL.so.2*



  o  If the new Mesa has a major version number that's greater than 2,
     you need to create a link to it with the name libMesaGL.so.2:



            cd /usr/local/lib/
            ln -s /wherever/you/installed/it/libMesaGL.so.3.0 libMesaGL.so.2
            ldconfig



  Now switch to a VC (CTRL+ALT+F1)  and start Quake II:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl



  3.7.4.  lib3dfxgl.so **

  With Quake II version 3.19, an alternative to the Mesa library is
  available.  lib3dfxgl.so is a mini-GL driver optimized for Quake that
  provides slightly better framerates than Mesa.  This is a port of a
  driver that 3Dfx developed for Quake under Windows, and apparently not
  all of its features work properly yet.  So hopefully we can expect its
  performance to improve with time.

  Like Mesa, lib3dfxgl.so requires Glide in order to access your 3Dfx
  card.  The Quake II packages come with a script, quake2.3dfxgl for
  running Quake II with this library on glibc systems.  The next
  paragraph explains how to run Quake II with lib3dfxgl.so on a libc5
  system.  On a glibc system, the glqwcl executable must not be setuid,
  nor should you run it as root.  glqwcl will silently load Mesa rather
  than lib3dfxgl.so if it runs with root permissions.  This non-root
  requirement implies that you have the /dev/3dfx driver installed.

  On a libc5 system, the non-root requirements mentioned above apply,
  but you also need to create a symbolic link to lib3dfxgl.so called
  libMesaGL.so.2 like so:


            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ln -sf lib3dfxgl.so libMesaGL.so.2



  Then start Quake II from a script that tells $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to look
  in the current directory:

  ______________________________________________________________________
       #!/bin/sh

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl $*

  ______________________________________________________________________



  You can tell which driver is being loaded by looking for output like
  the following in your console as Quake II starts:



            GL_VENDOR: 3Dfx Interactive Inc.
            GL_RENDERER: 3Dfx Interactive Voodoo^2(tm)
            GL_VERSION: 1.1
            GL_EXTENSIONS: 3DFX_set_global_palette WGL_EXT_swap_control GL_EXT_paletted_texture GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette GL_SGIS_multitexture



  If GL_VENDOR says Brian Paul rather than 3Dfx Interactive Inc., that
  means Mesa is still being used rather than the miniport dirver.


  3.8.  The GLX Renderer **


  ref_glx.so is linked against standard OpenGL libraries instead of
  Mesa.  This allows Quake II to run on other 3D hardware that is
  supported by other OpenGL implementations.  At this time, I dont' know
  of any OpenGL implementations that support hardware other than 3Dfx,
  but this renderer ensures that when they appear, we'll be able to play
  Quake II with them.

  This is a GLX application, and as such, must be run from X.

  You can use this client with Mesa/3Dfx if you install Mesa and Glide
  as explained in the previous section, then set the $MESA_GLX_FX
  environment variable to "fullscreen" before you run quake2:



       export MESA_GLX_FX=fullscreen
       ./quake2 +set vid_ref glx +set _windowed_mouse 1



  Why the +set _windowed_mouse 1 option?  Remember that this is an X
  application which happens to use your 3Dfx card.  Even though the
  display takes up your entire screen, Quake II is stil running in a
  window.  This means that if you're not very careful, you could move
  the mouse pointer outside the Quake II window, and Quake II will
  suddenly stop responding to mouse and keyboard input.  +set
  _windowed_mouse 1 avoids this problem by telling quake2 to grab the
  mouse and not let it move outside its window.


  3.9.  Linux-Specific Command Line Options

  This section will cover command line options that are specific to the
  Linux version of Quake II.  There are plenty of other Quake II
  options, but they're beyond the scope of this HOWTO.  Check out some
  of the sites listed in section ``General Quake Information'' for this
  kind of information.

  These are actually cvars (client variables) that you can set in the Q2
  console, but it makes the most sense to set them on the command line.
  Set them with +set on the command line, like:



            ./quake2 +set cd_dev /dev/hdc



     cd_dev device
        Name of the CD-ROM device.


     nocdaudio value
        Disable CD audio if value is nonzero


     sndbits num
        Set  sound bit sample size.  Default is 16.


     sndspeed num
        Set sound sample speed.  Usual values are 8000, 11025, 22051 and
        44100.  If set to zero, causes the sound driver to attempt
        speeds in the following order: 11025, 22051, 44100, 8000.


     sndchannels num
        Indicates stereo or mono sound.  Defaults to 2 (stereo). Use 1
        for mono.


     nostdout value
        Don't do any output to stdout.  Use this if you don't want all
        the console output dumped to your terminal.


  3.10.  Quake II Servers

  Linux's strength as an internet server make it a perfect platform for
  running an internet Quake II server.  This section will touch on the
  basics and Linux-specific aspects of starting up a Quake II server.
  More detailed information about running Quake II servers is available
  elsewhere (see section ``Other Sources of Information'' earlier in
  this document.


  3.10.1.  Listen Servers

  You can start a Quake II "Listen" server from within the game via the
  Multiplayer menu.  This allows you to host a game and participate in
  it at the same time.

  To start a Listen server, start Quake II, bring up the Quake II menu
  with the ESC key, and select Multiplayer.  It should be pretty self-
  explanatory from there.


  3.10.2.  Dedicated Servers

  For a permanent, stand-alone Quake II server that needs to run without
  constant attention, using the Listen server is impractical.  Quake II
  has a Dedicated server mode that is better suited to this type of use.
  A dedicated server is started from the command line and uses fewer
  system resources than a Listen server because it doesn't start the
  graphical client piece at all.

  To start a dedicated server, use the command line option +set
  dedicated 1.  You can set additional server parameters either on the
  command line or in a config file that you +exec on the command line.
  Your config file should reside in the baseq2 directory.

  A few common server options are listed below.  To set options on the
  command line, do +set fraglimit 30.  Options are set the same way in a
  config file, only you don't want the + before the set.  Invoke your
  config file like this: +exec server.cfg.


     fraglimit
        Number of frags required before the map changes

     timelimit
        Time in minutes that must pass before the map changes

     hostname
        The name of your Quake II server.  This is an arbitrary string
        and has nothing to do with your DNS hostname.

     maxclients
        The maximum number of players that can connect to the server at
        once.

  For enough Quake II console and command line information to choke a
  horse, see Farenheit 176 (http://www.planetquake.com/f176).


  3.10.3.  Other Sources of Server Information


  o  The Q2 Server FAQ has a basic step-by-step guide to set up a Q2
     Server under Linux: http://www.bluesnews.com/faqs/q2s-faq.html


  o  Grant Cornelius Reticulus Copernicus Sperry (flubber@xmission.com)
     has some basic Q2 server config files and startup scripts at
     http://www.atomicage.com:80/quake/server/server_cfg/.



  3.11.  Mods & Addons

  Quake II modifications like Capture the Flag, Jailbreak, and Lithium
  II are very popular extensions of the original Quake II game.  Some
  mods reside entirely on the server (Lithium), and some also require
  changes to your client (CTF).  For server only mods, you just connect
  normally and play.  Client-side mods require you to install additional
  files in your quake2 directory before you can play.


  3.11.1.  Client Side Mods

  Generally, installation of a client-side mod consists of just
  downloading the client package and upacking it in your Quake II
  directory, but you should refer to the mod's documentation for
  specific details.  It may be necessary to download a Linux-specific
  package in addition to the main (Windows) client package.  Also be
  aware that all mods may not be available for Linux.

  Client-side mod packages usually contain a new gamei386.so file and
  one or more .pak files.  Other new files may be included as well.
  These new files will be installed in a subdirectory below your Quake
  II directory.  Use +set game mod-dir on the command line to run the
  mod.  Rocket Arena 2, for example, gets installed in a directory
  called arena.  To play RA2, your would start your client like so:


             ./quake2 +set game arena



  3.11.1.1.  Capture the Flag

  Since this is by far the most popular variation of multiplayer Quake
  II, I've included specific instructions for installing this mod.
  Capture the Flag for Quake II is available from id's ftp site.
  Download it, then install like so:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            mkdir ctf
            cd ctf
            unzip -L /wherever/you/put/it/q2ctf102.zip



  Start Quake II with +set game ctf to play CTF.


  3.11.2.  Server Side Mods

  Running a Quake II mod on a server isn't much different than running
  one on the client side.  Generally you'll need to install gamei386.so
  and server.cfg files in a new subdirectory and then start your server
  like


            ./quake2 +set game XXXX +set dedicated 1 +exec server.cfg



  Where XXXX above is the name of the mod's new subdirectory.  The exact
  procedure will vary from mod to mod, of course.  See the mod's docu-
  mentation for specific details.


  3.11.3.  Game Source

  The entire game, with the exception of the engine itself, resides in a
  shared library, gamei386.so.  Quake II mods are created by changing
  the contents of this file.  The C source is freely available (section
  ``Download the Necessary Files'' above) for anyone to download and
  modify.

  After you've downloaded the source, here's how to get started with it:



             cd /usr/local/games/quake2
             mkdir mymod
             cd mymod
             gunzip /wherever/you/put/it/q2source-3.14.shar.Z
             sh /wherever/you/put/it/q2source-3.14.shar



  You'll be presented with a bunch of legalese that you must answer yes
  to, then the game source will be extracted.  Building a new
  gamei386.so out of these sources is accomplished with a simple make.
  You can run Quake II with the newly compiled library like so:



             cd /usr/local/games/quake2
             ./quake2 +set game mymod



  Not too exciting yet, since what you just built is identical to the
  "stock" gamei386.so, but this should be good information for aspiring
  mod authors.


  3.11.4.  Mission Packs **


  o  Mission Pack 1: The Reckoning The Reckoning requires Quake II
     version 3.15 or later to run.  You'll need at least 95 MB for a
     minimum installation.  Another 90 MB are required if you want to
     install the video sequences as well.  Assuming your CD is mounted
     on /mnt/cdrom and Quake II is installed in /usr/local/games/quake2:



       cd /usr/local/games/quake2
       cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Data/all/* xatrix/
       rm -f xatrix/gamex86.dll



  If you want to install the video sequences:



            cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Data/max/xatrix/video xatrix



  Play The Reckoning like this:


            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ./quake2 +set game xatrix



  o  Mission Pack 2: Ground Zero It requires Quake II version 3.17 or
     later to run.  You'll need at least 120 MB for a minimum
     installation.  Another 115 MB are required if you want to install
     the video sequences as well.  Assuming your CD is mounted on
     /mnt/cdrom and Quake II is installed in /usr/local/games/quake2:



            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Data/all/* rogue/
            rm -f rogue/gamex86.dll



  If you want to install the video sequences:



            cp -r /mnt/cdrom/Data/max/rogue/video rogue



  Play Ground Zero like this:


            cd /usr/local/games/quake2
            ./quake2 +set game rogue

  at the rate of about one per month.

  If you're familiar with GameSpy for the Windows platform, this is the
  closest thing to it for Linux.

  The XQF homepage is at http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf.


  4.3.  QuickSpy

  QuickSpy is a text-based QuakeWorld server browser.  It's another
  front-end to QStat and it works pretty well.  If you don't run X and
  you don't have Quake II, this is a decent option.  Beware though, it's
  no longer under development.


  You can get QuickSpy at
  http://diana.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~rht96r/quake/quickspy/.



  4.4.  QPlug for Linux

  Qplug is a Netscape plugin which retrieves and displays QuakeWorld and
  Quake II server information embedded in a web page. A Windows Qplug
  has been around for some time.  The author, Olivier Debon
  (odebon@club-internet.fr) wrote the Linux version from scratch without
  ever having seen the Windows version.

  QPlug for Linux can be got at
  http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/5084/qplug.html.


  4.5.  qkHacklib

  David Bucciarelli (tech.hmw@plus.it), author of the 3Dfx driver for
  Mesa, has written a library called qkHack, which tries to emulate all
  the SVGAlib/fxMesa functions used by Quake and Quake II.  This would
  remove the need for SVGAlib when running glquake or Quake II with
  ref_gl.  Other features from the qkHacklib README:


  o  You can dynamically switch between fullscreen rendering and the in
     window rendering just pressing the TAB key (you must start your X
     server in 16 bpp mode in order to use this feature)

  o  You can press Ctrl-C in the shell or kill the Quake process without
     problems

  o  you can enable/disable the mouse and keyboard 'grabbing' pressing
     F11/F12

  o  you can iconify and pause Quake pressing the F10 (it will not eat
     more CPU cycles). You can restart everything with a double click in
     the "****" icon

  o  you can run Quake with any Mesa driver (for example with the X11
     driver but you must recompile the Mesa without the Voodoo driver)

  o  you can run Quake under any Linux box and get the hardware
     acclerated output on a SGI box (OK, this is a bit exotic and
     theoretical as feature but it is an example of how powerful can be
     an GLX/OpenGL application)

  I've tried qkHacklib and it works great for Quake on my system.  In
  Quake II, however, the mouse response becomes really slow.  Others
  report complete success, though, so give it a try it it sounds like
  something you need.

  David Bucciarelli's qkHacklib web page is at http://www-
  hmw.caribel.pisa.it/fxmesa/fxqkhack.html.


  4.6.  GiMd2Viewer

  GiMd2Viewer is a Quake 2 model viewer written for Gtk and OpenGL by
  Lionel Ulmer (bbrox@mygale.org). It loads models and textures from
  either plain files or .PAK files.  It will also animate the models
  (with frame interpolation).

  This program is still under developement and I haven't tried it yet,
  but it sounds pretty nifty.  Check it out at
  http://www.mygale.org/~bbrox/GiMd2Viewer/.



  4.7.  QIPX

  QIPX is a set of programs that allow Linux Quake clients (using
  TCP/IP) to connect with DOS Quake clients (using IPX).  I guess this
  is useful if you're playing netquake on a LAN.  QIPX is available at
  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6083/qipx.html.


  4.8.  Ice

  Ice is a Quake map editor for UN*X created by C.J. Beyer and John
  Watson.  I haven't used this program, nor do I know what its
  development status is.  The Ice homepage is at
  http://styx.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~ice/.


  4.9.  Q2getty

  Q2getty is a hack of mingetty by Mike Gleason (mgleason@ncftp.com)
  that allows you to automatically run and respawn a program (like a
  Quake server) on a virtual console.  This program is available in the
  files section at http://www.ncftpd.com/unixstuff/q2getty.html.


  4.10.  rcon

  Rcon is a pair of tools that allow remote administration of a Quake II
  server using the RCON protocol.  Michael Dwyer
  (michael_dwyer@mwiworks.com) is the author.  Rcon 1.1 is available at
  .


  4.11.  qlog ++

  Qlog is a GPL'ed QuakeWorld/Quake II server log parser that generates
  comprehensive player statistics.   Craig Knudsen (cknudsen@radix.net)
  is the author.  The qlog homepage is
  http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/qlog/.


  4.12.  Cheapo **

  Cheapo is a proxy that can be used to route QuakeWorld network
  traffic. Additionally, the proxy can modify the data and has features
  for enhancing gameplay. You can connect to cheapo as if it were a
  Quakeworld server, and then give it commands that forward you to a
  real server.  The proxy can also be run on a firewall machine
  incapable of handling Quake traffic, so that machines inside the
  firewall can be used for playing.  The Cheapo homepage is at
  http://www.saunalahti.fi/~softech/.


  4.13.  qgraph **

  QGraph (Quake Graph) is a utility to help people in managing Quake's
  DeathMathes, turnments and Quakeworld games.  QGraph is a program who
  connects (via Lan or the Internet) to a Quake, QuakeII, Quakeworld and
  Hexen2 Servers and shows you realtime data about the game running on
  that server.  The QGraph homepage is at http://www.frag.com/qgraph.



  5.  Troubleshooting/FAQs



  5.1.  General



  5.1.1.  OS difference considerations


  o  Case sensitivity - In DOS and Windows, case is not important.
     BASE1.TXT is the same as base1.txt.  Under Linux and other unices,
     case IS significant.  MOTD.TXT and motd.txt are different files.
     This can cause problems with player models and skin files if
     they're installed with upper- or mixed-case filenames.
     players/male/santa.PCX needs to be renamed to santa.pcx in order to
     work in Linux.  The fixskins.sh script included with quakeworld
     will convert all filenames in a directory to lowercase. It's
     reproduced below for your convenience:

     ___________________________________________________________________
          #!/bin/sh
          for x in *; do
             y=`echo $x | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
             if [ $x != $y ]; then
                mv $x $y
             fi
          done

     ___________________________________________________________________



  o  Path delimiters - DOS and Windows use the backslash "\" character
     to separate file pathname elements.  In Unix, the backslash is an
     escape character.  If you use file pathnames in your config files
     (or your mod code, or anywhere else, for that matter), be sure
     you're using "/" and not "\".

  o  End of line characters - Under DOS/Windows, each line of a text
     file ends with a carriage return character (CR) and a linefeed
     character (LF).  Unix textfiles just have a linefeed at the end of
     each line.  Using DOS/Win formatted textfiles in Unix can cause all
     kinds of mysterious Quake problems.  Using the incorrectly
     formatted quake2.conf file from the Quake2 3.17 package, for
     example, gives the error "LoadLibrary("ref_XXX.so") failed: No such
     file or directory".  LMCTF-TE reports a floating point exception.
     If you've got an problem you can't explain, try removing the CRs
     from your text files:


            mv file.txt file.bak; tr -d '\r' < file.bak > file.txt



  5.1.2.  Glibc, RedHat 5.x, Debian 2 considerations**

  The following applies the Quake I binaries (squake, glquake, and
  quake.x11) only.  As of versions 2.30 and 3.19 respectively,
  QuakeWorld and Quake II are available in both libc5 and glibc
  versions.

  The Quake executables were compiled with libc5.  Newer Linux
  distributions like RedHat 5.1 and Debian 2.0 use the incompatible
  glibc as their default C library.  If you're running Quake on a glibc
  system, there are a few things to watch out for:
  o  Both RedHat 5 and Debian 2 have libc5 compatibility packages that
     allow you to run libc5-based applications.  Make sure you have
     these packages installed.  Both distributions put the libc5-based
     libraries in /usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib.

  o  Make sure Quake uses the correct libraries.  Create a script like
     the one below that points $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your compatibility
     libraries directory before it runs Quake.

     ___________________________________________________________________
          #!/bin/sh
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib
          ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl $*

     ___________________________________________________________________



  o  If you are going to compile a library like SVGAlib or Mesa for use
     with Quake, it must be compiled with libc5 and friends.  Simply
     building a new library according its installation instructions will
     result in a library that is linked against your default library,
     glibc.  You must ensure your new library is linked only with libc5
     and libc5-based libraries so it will be compatible with Quake.  See
     your distribution's documentation for information on linking to the
     non-default libraries.



  5.1.3.  My mouse doesn't work or seems to respond randomly.


  o  Is gpm running?  gpm is a program that enables you to cut and paste
     with the mouse in virtual consoles.  Many distributions enable it
     by default.  It may be interfering with Quake.  Check if it's
     running with the following command:


            ps aux | grep gpm



  If you get output like


            root      6115  0.0  0.4   832   316  ?  S   17:54   0:00 gpm -t PS/2



  then gpm is running and interfering with Quake.  gpm -k (as root)
  ought to stop gpm.  If it doesn't (gpm -k doesn't always work on my
  system),  kill gpm with the command killall gpm.

  If you never use gpm, you may want to stop it from running at startup.
  See the documentation for your distribution for information on how to
  do this.


  o  Is your mouse defined properly in libvga.config?  This file usually
     lives in /etc or /etc/vga.  Open it up and look for a line like


       mouse Microsoft



  On my system, this is the first option in the file.  Make sure the
  mouse type is appropriate for your hardware.



  5.1.4.  My Microsoft Intellimouse or Logitech MouseMan+ isn't working
  correctly.

  SVGAlib, which handles mouse input for SVGA and GL Quake/QW/Q2, didn't
  directly support the Intellimouse until version 1.3.0.  If you have a
  version of SVGAlib prior to 1.3.0, you should upgrade, then use mouse
  type IntelliMouse (for serial mice) or IMPS2 (for PS/2 mice) in your
  libvga.config file.


  5.1.5.  My mouse is "laggy" and seems much slower than under Windows.


  o  For many people, just cranking up the value of sensitivity in the
     game console cures the problem.  Setting sensitivity by hand in the
     console or in a .cfg file allows you to increase the mouse
     sensitivity more than the slider in the Options menu.  sensitivity
     15, for example.

  o  From Zoid's 1/7/98 .plan update:

       If you are experience video 'lag' in the GL renderer (the
       frame rate feels like it's lagging behind your mouse move-
       ment) type "gl_finish 1" in the console. This forces update
       on a per frame basis.



  o  The latest version of SVGAlib (1.3.0) provides a slew of parameters
     in libvga.config that you can use to customize the behavior of your
     mouse.  With the proper settings it should be possible to make your
     mouse feel any way you want.  On my system, just changing
     mouse_accel_type to normal (default is power) gave me the results I
     wanted.  I haven't messed with the other settings, and I don't
     pretend to have a clue about what they all do.

  o  The little slider


  5.1.6.  I have a Voodoo2, and, when I try to run with the gl renderer,
  it reports that I don't have a Voodoo card installed.

  There are different versions of Glide for Voodoo and Voodoo 2 cards.
  Be sure you downloaded the correct one for your system.



  5.1.7.  When I'm playing any of the Quake games under SVGAlib or GL
  and press CTRL-C, the game exits and sometimes leaves my console in an
  unusable state.

  5.1.8.  Sometimes when Quake/Quake II exits abnormally, it leaves my
  console unusable.


  Yes.  This bites.  SVGAlib catches the CTRL-C and decides what to do
  with it instead of allowing Quake to handle it.  I know of no way
  around this short of hacking SVGAlib.

  If you run your Quake games from a script that resets the keyboard and
  terminal like the one below, you'll run less chance of ending up with
  a hosed terminal if this does happen, though.


  ______________________________________________________________________
       #!/bin/sh
       ./quake2 $*
       kbd_mode -a
       reset

  ______________________________________________________________________



  5.1.9.  squake/quake2 fails to start and says " svgalib: cannot get
  I/O permissions"

  The Quake executables must run as root, so you must either run them as
  root or make them setuid root.  See the installation instructions in
  this document for details.


  5.1.10.  Sometimes after  playing one of the Quake games in X, key
  repeat doesn't work any more.

  For some reason, the X11 versions of Quake disable key repeat while
  they're running.  If the program exits abnormally for some reason, key
  repeat never get turned back on. Do


            xset r on



  to reenable it.


  5.1.11.  Quake/Quake II says "/dev/dsp : device not configured"

  Your sound hardware is not properly configured.  You may simply need
  to do a insmod sound, or it may be necessary to rebuild your kernel.
  RedHat users may need to invoke the sndconfig(8) utility.  See the
  documentation for your Linux distribution and/or the Linux Sound HOWTO
  for information on configuring your system's sound hardware.


  5.1.12.  GL Quake/Quake II run slower in Linux than in Windows. **

  The Windows 3Dfx GL miniport is heavily optimized for the things Quake
  II does.  Mesa on the other hand, is more general and less optimized
  As a result, Linux Quake II runs slower than under Windows.  This
  isn't a limitation of Linux, but a limitation of the current drivers.

  With the most recent releases of QuakeWorld and Quake II, the 3Dfx
  miniport mentioned above is available for Linux.  While it still
  doesn't bring Linux Quake performance to par with Windows Quake, it's
  another step in that direction.

  Additionally, for Pentium Pro and Pentium II users, there are some
  tweaks than can be done with memory buffering - the latest /dev/3dfx
  device driver has support for automatically setting this up for you.
  Enabling MTRRs can result in significant (10 fps on my system) GL
  Quake speedups. See http://glide.xxedgexx.com/MTRR.html for some more
  detailed information about this.


  5.1.13.  How can I start a server and log off, then come back to it
  later? **

  screen(1) is a great utility for this sort of thing.  It allows you to
  create many virtual screens in one tty and switch between them.
  Screen comes with most distributions.  You can download it from
  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu or any GNU mirror.

  Start screen by typing the command screen, then create a new screen
  window by pressing CTRL-A CTRL-C.  You won't see much as you do these
  things, but be assured, something is happening.

  Start a Quakeworld server:


            /usr/local/games/quake/qwsv



  Now open a new screen window with CTRL-A CTRL-C and start up a Quake
  II server:


            /usr/local/games/quake2/quake2 +set dedicated 1



  You can switch back and forth between your servers by pressing CTRL-A
  CTRL-N.

  Press CTRL-A CTRL-D to detach from the screen program.  Screen and
  your servers are still running, but they're no longer visible in your
  terminal window.  You can logoff now and your processes will continue
  to run normally.

  Use screen -r to re-attach to your previous screen process and access
  your servers again.

  That's all there is to it.  See the screen(1) man page for more
  detailed information.



  5.2.  Quake/QuakeWorld


  5.2.1.  Quake dies at startup with a segmentation fault.

  This usually means your network setup isn't right.  Try starting quake
  with the -noudp option and see if the error goes away.  If that fixes
  it, check your /etc/hosts file and verify there's an entry for your
  machine in it.  Use 127.0.0.1 for your IP address if you have a dialup
  account that gives you a different address each time you connect.


  5.2.2.  What's the difference between glqwcl , glqwcl.3dfxgl , and
  glqwcl.glx ? ++


  o  glqwcl is the standard GL Quakeworld client you've seen in previous
     versions.  It's linked against libMesaGL.so.2.

  o  glqwcl.3dfxgl is a script that runs glqwcl after preloading the
     3Dfx GL miniport library, lib3dfxgl.so.  Preloading the minport
     library causes its GL functions to get used instead of Mesa's.
     Since the GL minport is optimized for Quake, this is a good thing.

  o  glqwcl.glx is linked against standard OpenGL libriaries instead of
     Mesa.  This will allow glquake to run on other 3D hardware that is
     supported by some other OpenGL implementation.  This is an X
     application and so must be run from X.


  5.2.3.  When I run glqwcl.glx  fullscreen from X, I can't use my mouse
  or keyboard. ++


  Run glqwcl.glx with the +_windowed_mouse 1 option. GLX Quakeworld is
  running in a window, even though it appears to take up your whole
  screen.  If you move the mouse while the WM is in focus-follows-mouse
  mode, you're likely to move the pointer outside this window, and then
  Quake will stop responding to mouse and keyboard input.
  +_windowed_mouse 1 makes Quakeworld grab the mouse exclusively.


  5.3.  Quake II


  5.3.1.  When I try to run Quake II with the GL renderer, it fails and
  says "LoadLibrary("ref_gl.so") failed: Unable to resolve symbol"

  If immediately prior to the "Unable to resolve symbol" line, you have
  messages like "can't resolve symbol 'fxMesaCreateContext'", your Mesa
  library doesn't have glide support compiled in.  See section ``The GL
  renderer'' in the Quake II installation section for information on
  installing Mesa and glide.


  5.3.2.  Quake II fails with the message LoadLibrary("ref_XXX.so")
  failed: No such file or directory


  o  /etc/quake2.conf doesn't have the correct path to your Quake II
     directory in it.  This file should contain one line that is the
     directory Quake II lives in.

  o  If /etc/quake2.conf does contain the correct path, try removing the
     file and re-creating it by hand.  Some versions of Quake II for
     Linux included an incorrectly formatted quake2.conf file.


  o  Do you have SVGAlib installed?  Check /lib, /usr/lib and
     /usr/local/lib for a file called libvga.so.1.X.X, where the X's are
     some numbers.  If nothing turns up, you need to get and install
     SVGAlib to run Quake II outside of X.

  o  If the renderer in question is ref_gl.so, Mesa may not be properly
     installed.  Did you copy libMesaGL.so.2.6 to a library directory
     like the installation instruactions told you to?


  o  If the renderer in question is ref_gl.so, did you install the glide
     libraries?



  5.3.3.  When I update the brightness while using the GL renderer, and
  hit "apply," nothing happens!


  Type vid_restart in the console to make the changes take affect.



  5.3.4.  Note about the 3.17 distribution


  As of this writing, the most recent Quake II version is 3.19.  If for
  some reason, you're running version 3.17 instead, the following
  information may be helpful to you.

  Two text files (quake2.conf and fixperms.sh) in the 3.17 distribution
  were inadvertently saved in MS-DOS CR/LF text-file format instead of
  the unix LF format.  This means there's an extra carriage return
  character at the end of each line in these files and they're not going
  to behave right until you fix them.

  We'll run them through tr(1) to strip out the CR's.



            for i in fixperms.sh quake2.conf
            do
            mv $i $i.bak
            tr -d '\r' < $i.bak > $i
            done



  5.3.5.  When I run Quake II with +set vid_ref glx  fullscreen from X,
  I can't use my mouse or keyboard. ++


  Run GLX quake2 with the +set _windowed_mouse 1 option. GLX Quake2 is
  running in a window, even though it appears to take up your whole
  screen.  If you move the mouse while the WM is in focus-follows-mouse
  mode, you're likely to move the pointer outside this window, and then
  Quake II will stop responding to mouse and keyboard input.  +set
  _windowed_mouse 1 makes Quake II grab the mouse exclusively.


  5.3.6.  Why can't I change to some of the SVGA modes that aree in the
  Quake II Video menu? **

  SVGAlib probably doesn't know how to create the modes on your card.
  When Quake II starts up with the SVGA renderer (ref_soft.so), it
  prints a list of all the modes that SVGAlib tells it are available:



       ------- Loading ref_soft.so -------
       Using RIVA 128 driver, 4096KB.
       mode 320: 200 1075253220
       mode 320: 240 1075253220
       mode 320: 400 1075253220
       mode 360: 480 1075253220
       mode 640: 480 1075253220
       mode 800: 600 1075253220
       mode 1024: 768 1075253220
       mode 1280: 1024 1075253220



  These are the only modes you will be able to successfully switch to
  from the Video menu.  If say, 512x384 isn't on the list, selecting it
  from the Video menu won't work.

  SVGAlib does let you define new video modes for some chipsets in
  libvga.config, so you may be able create your own video mode this way.
  See the SVGAlib documentation for more detail on this topic.



  6.  Tips & Tricks



  6.1.  Running X and GL games without setuid

  If you only run the X and GL versions of Quake, QuakeWorld or Quake
  II, you don't need to run them with root permissions.  SVGA is the
  only mode that must be run as root.  The X versions just need access
  to /dev/dsp, the sound device.  The GL versions need access to the
  3Dfx card as well as to /dev/dsp.

  /dev/dsp needs to be readable and writeable by Quake.  Most
  distributions give it 662 (rw-rw--w-) permissions by default.  The
  simplest solution is to just chmod 666 /dev/dsp.  On most systems, the
  ability to read from the sound device will not pose a significant
  security threat.  If this approach is unacceptable for your system,
  create a group that owns /dev/dsp and make your Quake players members
  of that group.

  You need the /dev/3dfx driver from Daryll Strauss' glide page
  (http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html) in order run glide
  applications (like GLQuake) non-root.  Download the Device3Dfx.xxx.rpm
  package and install according to the instructions on the web page.
  After you've installed the driver, make sure /dev/3dfx has 666
  permissions (chmod 666 /dev/3dfx).

  When /dev/dsp and /dev/3dfx are properly set up, you can remove the
  setuid bit from your Quake/QW/Q2 executables.  Just do (as root) chmod
  0755 XXXXX, where XXXXX is either glquake, quake.x11, or quake2.

  If you've been playing as root prior to making these changes, many of
  your Quake files (like savegames) may be owned by root and
  inaccessible to a normal user, so remember to change the files'
  ownership before you attempt to play the game non-root.



  6.2.  Running SVGA and GL games from X**

  The GLX Quakeworld and Quake II clients are native X applications, but
  since they use Mesa rather than the 3Dfx mini-driver, they're slower
  than the lib3dfxgl.so versions.  For this reason, you may still favor
  this way of starting games from X over using the GLX clients.

  This is based on a Linux Gazette 2 Cent Tip by Joey Hess
  (joey@kite.ml.org) The original is at
  http://www.ssc.com/lg/issue20/lg_tips20.html#squake

  Yes, it's possible to run the Quake games from X if you're root, but
  such behavior is naughty, and you still run the risk of having Quake
  crash and leave the console unresponsive.  With a little work you can
  make it possible for a regular user to run SVGA and GL Quake from X
  AND automatically switch back to X when the program is finished,
  regardless of whether it exited normally or not.

  Note: when I say "Quake" in the text below, I really mean "quake,
  glquake squake, qwcl, glqwcl, qwcl.x11 or quake2".


  o  First, you'll need the open(1) package by Jon Tombs. This is a set
     of two very small programs that allow you to switch between virtual
     consoles and start programs on them.  Download open from
     http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/console/.  You shouldn't
     have to do much more than make;make install to compile and install
     it. Once it's installed, you need to make the open and switchto
     executables setuid root.  So do this:


            cd /usr/local/bin
            chown root open switchto
            chmod 4755 open switchto



  o  Next, save the following code to a file called getvc.c:



     ___________________________________________________________________
             /* getvc.c
              * Prints the number of the current VC to stdout. Most of this code
              * was ripped from the open program, and this code is GPL'd
              *
              * Joey Hess, Fri Apr  4 14:58:50 EST 1997
              */

              #include <sys/vt.h>
              #include <fcntl.h>

              main () {
                int fd = 0;
                struct vt_stat vt;

                if ((fd = open("/dev/console",O_WRONLY,0)) < 0) {
                  perror("Failed to open /dev/console\n");
                  return(2);
                }
                if (ioctl(fd, VT_GETSTATE, &vt) < 0) {
                  perror("can't get VTstate\n");
                  close(fd);
                  return(4);
                }
                printf("%d\n",vt.v_active);
              }

              /* End of getvc.c */

     ___________________________________________________________________


  Compile it and install it somewhere in your $PATH:


            gcc getvc.c -o getvc
            strip getvc
            mv getvc /usr/local/bin



  o  Now create a script called runvc: your $PATH:

     ___________________________________________________________________
          #!/bin/sh
          # Run something on a VC, from X, and switch back to X when done.
          # GPL Joey Hess, Thu, 10 Jul 1997 23:27:08 -0400
          exec open -s -- sh -c "$* ; chvt `getvc`"

     ___________________________________________________________________


  Make it executable and put it somewhere in your $PATH:


            chmod 755 runvc
            mv runvc /usr/local/bin



  Now you can use the runvc command to start Quake. Continue to use
  whatever command line you usually use to start your game, but put
  runvc at the beginning:


            runvc ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl +connect quake.foo.com



  You'll automatically switch to a VC, run Quake and then switch back to
  X when it's done!



  6.3.  Keeping the mouse inside the window in X

  From the Quake II readme.linux file:

       By default, the mouse will not be 'tied' to the Quake2 win-
       dow.  To cause Quake2 to grab the mouse, select 'Windowed
       Mouse' from the video menu, or type '_windowed_mouse 0' at
       the console.  Do the reverse to release it.  You can bind
       keys to grab and release the mouse in the console, like so:
       bind i "_windowed_mouse 1" bind o "_windowed_mouse 0" Then
       "i" will grab the mouse and "o" will release it.



  6.4.  3Dfx "tweak" settings work in Linux too

  You may have seen or heard mention of ways to "tweak" Quake's OpenGL
  performance by setting various environment variables.  These variables
  are equally valid under Linux. You just set them slightly differently.
  If a Windows/DOS "tweak" guide tells you to:


            SET SST_GRXCLK=59



  Under Linux, do it like this:


            export SST_GRXCLK=59



  6.5.  The Poor Man's Server Browser

  Joe S. (jszabo@eden.rutgers.edu) suggests:


            a trick I do with qstat:
            I make a file of my favorite servers, then do
            qstat -f /C/quake2/file.txt | less



  hit control z to suspend, then copy the ip address or hostname I want
  with gpm to a command line like:



            ./quake2 +connect expert.eqclans.com



  Then I can use fg to go back to the list later...


  6.6.  Using lib3dfxgl.so  for Quake I**

  You can use the 3Dfx mini-driver (lib3dfxgl.so) from Quakeworld or
  Quake II with glquake too. Simply copy the glqwcl.3dfxgl or
  quake2.3dfxgl scripts to a new file, say glquake.3dfxgl. Then edit the
  glquake.3dfxgl script so it runs glquake instead of glqwcl.  The same
  restrictions about running as root apply here, as do the differences
  between running under glibc and libc5.  See the ``Quakeworld'' or
  ``Quake II'' sections for more information on lib3dfxgl.so.
