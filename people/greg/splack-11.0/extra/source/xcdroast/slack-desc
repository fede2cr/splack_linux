# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xcdroast: xcdroast (Graphical frontend for cdrtools)
xcdroast:
xcdroast: X-CD-Roast is a graphical frontend for the command line cdrtools.
xcdroast: You can do anything X-CD-Roast does yourself using the command line
xcdroast: tools - but it's nicer and easier with the frontend.  The cdrtools
xcdroast: contain "cdrecord" (which does the actual writing of CDs), "readcd"
xcdroast: (reads data tracks of CDs"), "mkisofs" (masters CD images), and
xcdroast: "cdda2wav" (reads audio tracks).  Cdrecord, readcd and mkisofs are
xcdroast: maintained by Joerg Schilling, cdda2wav by Heiko Eissfeldt, and
xcdroast: X-CD-Roast by Thomas Niederreiter.
