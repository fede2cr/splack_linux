# Listing a module here prevents the hotplug scripts from loading it.
# Usually that'd be so that some other driver will bind it instead,
# no matter which driver happens to get probed first.  Sometimes user
# mode tools can also control driver binding.
#
# Syntax:  driver name alone (without any spaces) on a line. Other
# lines are ignored.

# uhci ... usb-uhci handles the same pci class, so one of the two
# needs to be listed below.
usb-uhci
# usbcore ... module is loaded implicitly, ignore it otherwise
usbcore

# tulip ... de4x5, xircom_tulip_cb, dmfe (...) handle same devices
de4x5

# At least 2.4.3 and later xircom_tulip doesn't have that conflict
# xircom_tulip_cb
dmfe

#evbug is a debug tool and should be loaded explicitly

# Alternate Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 support driver.  List it
# here so it won't conflict with an already-loaded eepro100 module.

# Alternate 8139 driver.  Some 8139 cards need this specific driver,
# though...
8139cp

# Modules used to run a wireless adaptor as an access point.  These
# conflict with the normal driver for the device, and so should be
# loaded manually.

# OSS (Open Sound System) modules.  This is the old and deprecated Linux
# sound system, though we still ship modules for it (for now).  If you
# want to use OSS, remove the alsa-driver package and cut out (or comment
# out) this list.  With these modules blacklisted ALSA will load by default.
