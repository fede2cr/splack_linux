patches/packages/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.5-i686-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to thunderbird-2.0.0.5.  Since Thunderbird shares the browser engine
  with Firefox it is susceptible to similar vulnerabilities.  This update fixes
  the same issues fixed in the recent Firefox patch.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#thunderbird
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/seamonkey-1.1.3-i486-1_slack11.tgz:
  Upgraded to seamonkey-1.1.3.  This is presumably a security update, but the
  details on the net have been sparse.  So far nothing has appeared at the
  usual URL, but I would treat this as a security update unless it is announced
  as otherwise.
  For more information (if/when it appears), see:

  This upgrade fixes a couple of minor security bugs.  Nobody here is launching
  Firefox from Internet Explorer, right?  :-)

patches/packages/gd-2.0.35-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to gd-2.0.35.
    This fixes a few possible security issues:
     * Possible infinite loop in the PNG reader
     * Possible integer overflow in gdImageCreateTrueColor
     * Possible crash in gdImageCreateXbm
     * Numerous flaws in the GIF reader

patches/packages/libexif-0.6.16-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to libexif-0.6.16.
  An integer overflow in libexif can crash applications that use the library
  on malformed images.  The upstream advisory indicates that this flaw could
  also be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user, but no
  exploit is known (by us) to exist among iDefense's researchers or in the
  wild.  But, as a crash bug and heap overflow one must suppose that the
  possibility exists.

extra/php5/php-5.2.3-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
Upgraded to php-5.2.3.
  Here's some basic information about the release from php.net:
    "This release continues to improve the security and the stability of the
    5.X branch as well as addressing two regressions introduced by the
    previous 5.2 releases.  These regressions relate to the timeout handling
    over non-blocking SSL connections and the lack of HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA in
    certain conditions.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release."

patches/packages/seamonkey-1.1.1-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to seamonkey-1.1.1.  Removed various symlinks to NSS libraries.
  If you plan to rebuild the pidgin package in unsupported/pidgin/stable for
  any reason (you shouldn't need to), first upgrade to this package and then
  upgradepkg --reinstall the mozilla-nss package.

testing/packages/bash-3.2.017-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-3.2.017.
  Moved here from /patches/packages.  Honestly, I think /testing may be a
  better place for bash-3.2 for a while longer -- it's causing trouble with
  many old scripts.  So, we'll give it a while longer to stabilize and for
  scripts to catch up to any syntax changes which may have occured.

  which is (was) breaking compiles.  Now it is in the right place.
  Thanks to Robby Workman for pointing it out.

Wed Apr 25 15:19:06 CDT 2007
patches/packages/fontconfig-2.4.2-i486-2_slack11.0.tgz:
  Changed the font paths in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf to point to where the
  fonts actually are, rather than through a symlink.  The symlink
  (/usr/X11R6/lib/fonts) *should* be made by the aaa_base package, but
  still it's probably best to point to the real location.
  Thanks to Zoran Davidovac for the suggestion.
  Moved man pages to the proper location and gzipped them.
  Created a /var/cache/fontconfig directory.

Fri Apr 20 13:47:39 CDT 2007
patches/packages/x11-6.9.0-i486-14_slack11.0.tgz:
  Removed old versions of fc-cache and fc-list.
  Somehow a couple of old fontconfig binaries snuck into this package, and
  prevent fc-cache from working properly at boot (or any other time).
  If you've already installed these upgrades, reinstalling the fontconfig
  package will fix the issue.  If you do that, there's no need to reinstall
  this new x11 package -- it's been fixed so that there's no longer a problem
  with the package install order (and because those fc-* binaries didn't
  belong there).  Sorry for any inconvenience...
  Thanks to Petri Kaukasoina for pointing this out.

  Upgraded to xine-lib-1.1.6.
  This fixes overflows in xine-lib in some little-used media formats in
  xine-lib < 1.1.5 and other bugs in xine-lib < 1.1.6.  The overflows in
  xine-lib < 1.1.5 could definitely cause an application using xine-lib to
  crash, and it is theorized that a malicious media file could be made to run
  arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.

patches/packages/file-4.20-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to file-4.20.
  This fixes a heap overflow that could allow code to be executed as the
  user running file (note that there are many scenarios where file might be
  used automatically, such as in virus scanners or spam filters).

patches/packages/ktorrent-2.1.3-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to ktorrent-2.1.3.
  A directory traversal vulnerability in torrent.cpp in versions < 2.1.2 may
  allow remote attackers to overwrite the ktorrent user's files.  A bug in
  chunkcounter.cpp in versions < 2.1.2 allows remote attackers to crash
  ktorrent and cause heap corruption by the use of an invalid idx value.

patches/packages/bash-3.2.015-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bash-3.2 patchlevel 15.  This is an optional upgrade
  issued due to some problem reports concerning the use of the old-
  style backquotes in scripts.  For example `ls -l` might fail where
  $(ls -l) works (though the real-world examples are more complex
  than these, of course.  I'd say if you're not having problems with
  bash you're better off leaving it alone, but if you're getting an
  error like "unexpected EOF looking for matching `", you may wish
  to give this package a try.
  Thanks much to John Pate for helping with late-night debugging.

patches/packages/fetchmail-6.3.6-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to fetchmail-6.3.6.  This fixes two security issues.  First, a bug
  introduced in fetchmail-6.3.5 could cause fetchmail to crash.  However,
  no stable version of Slackware ever shipped fetchmail-6.3.5.  Second, a long
  standing bug (reported by Isaac Wilcox) could cause fetchmail to send a
  password in clear text or omit using TLS even when configured otherwise.
  All fetchmail users are encouraged to consider using getmail, or to upgrade
  to the new fetchmail packages.

  Upgraded to proftpd-1.3.0a plus an additional security patch.  Several
  security issues were found in proftpd that could lead to the execution of
  arbitrary code by a remote attacker, including one in mod_tls that does
  not require the attacker to be authenticated first.

extra/mozilla-firefox-2.0/mozilla-firefox-2.0-i686-1.tgz:  Moved from /patches,
  since it was pointed out that this sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use the libraries
  in /usr/lib/firefox-2.0/ which aren't compatible with the SeaMonkey libraries
  that are used to compile the gxine plugin, breaking it.  I'm currently
  looking for a workaround for this issue, but meanwhile using firefox-1.5.0.8
  with the gxine plugin works just fine.  Honestly, I hadn't expected to see
  another firefox-1.x release once 2.0 came out or I might not have added it to
  Slackware 11.0 after the release...

patches/packages/bind-9.3.2_P2-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.3.2-P2.  This fixes some security issues related to
  previous fixes in OpenSSL.  The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to
  OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws
  in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you
  have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable
  security problem in named.  In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed
  from 3 to 65537.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously BIND's
  default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging
  of RRSIGs.

extra/php5/php-5.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.0.
  This release "includes a large number of new features, bug fixes and security
  enhancements."  In particular, when the UTF-8 charset is selected there are
  buffer overflows in the htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities() that may be
  exploited to execute arbitrary code.
  More details about the vulnerability may be found here:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5465
  Further details about the release can be found in the release announcement:
    http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_0.php
  Some syntax has changed since PHP 5.1.x.  An upgrading guide may be found at
  this location:
    http://www.php.net/UPDATE_5_2.txt
  This package was placed in /extra rather than /patches to save people from
  possible surprises with automated upgrade tools, since users of PHP4 and
  PHP 5.1.x applications may need to make some code changes before things will
  work again.
  (* Security fix *)

patches/packages/screen-4.0.3-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to screen-4.0.3.
  This addresses an issue with the way screen handles UTF-8 character encoding
  that could allow screen to be crashed (or possibly code to be executed in the
  context of the screen user) if a specially crafted sequence of pseudo-UTF-8
  characters are displayed withing a screen session.

  Upgraded to Mozilla Firefox 2.0.  This is a completely optional enhanced
  feature package update.  Usually I'd reserve this space only for security
  patches (which this is not), but Firefox 2.0 is just so cool that I couldn't
  resist upgrading it, especially with Slackware 11.0 so recently released.

patches/packages/qt-3.3.7-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to qt-x11-free-3.3.7.
  This fixes an issue with Qt's handling of pixmap images that causes Qt linked
  applications to crash if a specially crafted malicious image is loaded.
  Inspection of the code in question makes it seem unlikely that this could
  lead to more serious implications (such as arbitrary code execution), but it
  is recommended that users upgrade to the new Qt package.

  (* Security fix *)
n/openssh-4.4p1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-4.4p1.
  This fixes a few security related issues.  From the release notes found at
  http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4:
    * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
      that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
      expired.
    * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
      handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
      to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
      OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
      pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
      is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
      remote.
    * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
      be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

    After this upgrade, make sure the permissions on /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd are set
  the way you want them.  Future upgrades will respect the existing permissions
  settings.  Thanks to Manuel Reimer for pointing out that upgrading openssh
  would enable a previously disabled sshd daemon.
    Do better checking of passwd, shadow, and group to avoid adding
    redundant entries to these files.  Thanks to Menno Duursma.
  (* Security fix *)
n/openssl-0.9.8d-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.8d.
  This fixes a few security related issues:
      During the parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error
    condition is mishandled.  This can result in an infinite loop which
    consumes system memory (CVE-2006-2937).  (This issue did not affect
    OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.7)
    Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.
      Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts of
    time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a denial of
    service attack (CVE-2006-2940).
    Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.
      A buffer overflow was discovered in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers()
    utility function.  An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an
    application that uses this function and overrun a buffer.
    (CVE-2006-3738)
    Thanks to Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team.
      A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. When a client
    application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious
    server, that server could cause the client to crash (CVE-2006-4343).

ap/vorbis-tools-1.1.1-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed UTF8 support.
  Thanks to Igor Pashev for providing a simple patch from Gene Pavlovsky.
kernels/huge26.s/*:  Added support for USB and IEEE1394 storage devices.
kernels/test26.s/*:  Added support for USB and IEEE1394 storage devices.
  Thanks to Tais M. Hansen for pointing out that these kernels lacked support
  for USB storage devices.  Using these kernels with udev may cause a few
  warnings at boot time as udev attempts to load the already built-in support,
  but these seem to be harmless.

a/aaa_base-11.0.0-noarch-2.tgz:  Updated the "Welcome to Slackware" email.
  Added /media directory, subdirectories, and symbolic links recommended by
  the FHS, along with README files to help me understand the difference
  between this directory and /mnt.  ;-)
a/etc-11.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Fixed a bug in /etc/csh.login that caused repeated
  use of "csh -l" to duplicate search directories in the $path.  Clearly
  /etc/csh.login should set the path just as /etc/profile does.
  This bug dates back at at least 1997, maybe earlier, so congratulations to
  Dimitar Zhekov for winning this release's "smite the oldest bug" award.
  Added distcc port to /etc/services.  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp and
  Robby Workman for the continual reminders.  ;-)
a/pkgtools-11.0.0-i486-4.tgz:  Made upgradepkg a little bit more gentle -- if
  it is run on a corrupted .tgz it will no longer remove the original package.
  Thanks to Ric Anderson for the report.
  Added rc.scanluns to the services setup menu.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-69.tgz:  Fixed path to /sbin/initscript shown in init.8
  (again).  Thanks to Robby Workman.
  Changed rc.S to run rc.serial according to whether the script is executable.
a/util-linux-2.12r-i486-5.tgz:  Treat /etc/rc.d/rc.serial (to preserve file
  permissions), /etc/serial.conf, and /etc/fdprm as '.new' config files.
ap/lm_sensors-2.10.0-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed hardcoded /usr/local paths in
  sensors-detect.  Thanks to Jakub Jankowski.
kde/kdebase-3.5.4-i486-7.tgz:  Patched to fix media:/ URLs in Konqueror without
  requiring HAL.  Thanks to everyone involved in reporting this issue and
  seeing that it was addressed:
    http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132281

a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-68.tgz:  In rc.M, start rc.hplip if found.  Fix the path
  to /sbin/initscript shown in init.8.  Thanks to Robby Workman.
xap/sane-1.0.18-i486-3.tgz:  Added HPLIP backend (hpaio) to dll.conf.
testing/packages/cups-1.2.4/cups-1.2.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.2.4.
  The web site says that more problems were fixed.  I would still approach
  this one cautiously, though I'm sure it (or its descendent) will be used
  in Slackware 11.1.  Unless you have a reason to need this now, I'd wait.
testing/packages/hplip-1.6.9-i486-1.tgz:  Added hplip-1.6.9, a complete print,
  scan, and fax system for HP devices.  This isn't being merged into the AP
  series as a replacement for hpijs solely because I'd like to see it get more
  testing first.  It is working perfectly here.  Thanks to Robby Workman for
  doing the vast majority of the work on this package.  :-)
testing/packages/gutenprint-5.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Don't overwrite GIMP's "print"
  plugin -- instead install the plugin as "gutenprint".

Thu Sep 21 04:05:03 CDT 2006
This is still Slackware 11.0 release candidate 5 (for now), and is still the
  last release candidate, scout's honor.  We are nearly there.  :-)
a/devs-2.3.1-noarch-25.tgz:  Added /dev/i2c-* devices.
  Thanks to Jean Delvare.
  Just a reminder on devs, as I've had some email about it.  As it stands, devs
  is required to boot even if the machine runs a 2.6+ kernel and uses udev.
a/hotplug-2004_09_23-noarch-11.tgz:  Don't allow dhcpcd -k to make noise at
  shutdown time if dhcpcd is not running (as in cases where it was shut down
  manually, or the lease time was infinite).
a/logrotate-3.7.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to logrotate-3.7.4.  After reading the
  diff -u and doing some test rotations, this seems safe to include for 11.0.
  Suggested by Mateus César Gröess and Rafal Lorenc.
  Rotate /var/log/btmp.  Thanks to James Michael Fultz.
a/pkgtools-11.0.0-i486-3.tgz:  Stripped /bin/dialog.  Thanks to mRgOBLIN for
  saving us 18K of hard drive space.  :-)
  In setup.services, rename rc.portmap to rc.rpc.  This is no longer started
  by default.  Instead you must turn it on (only if you plan on mounting NFS
  partitions manually).  Otherwise, it will be run regardless of exec perms if
  NFS shares or mounts are detected at boot time.
ap/diffstat-1.43-i486-1.tgz:  Added Thomas Dickey's diffstat utility.
  Suggested by Michael Iatrou.
ap/lm_sensors-2.10.0-i486-2.tgz:  Edited slack-desc since the package contains
  only the tools for lm_sensors, not the drivers.  In the case of the 2.6+
  kernel, these are included with the kernel-modules package.  For 2.4, the
  modules would have to be built by the end user.  Also, there is still no
  startup script included for this package, but that's something that will be
  looked at for the next development cycle.  Removed the mkdev.sh after
  including the i2c devices in the devs package.
  Thanks again to Jean Delvare for the advice, and for his work maintaining
  lm_sensors upstream.  :-)
n/mailx-12.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mailx-12.1 from nail-11.25 (renamed).
  Thanks to Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi for pointing this out.
n/nfs-utils-1.0.10-i486-3.tgz:  Moved rpc.lockd and rpc.statd to /sbin.
  Reworked rc.nfsd to make use of the rc.rpc script in "portmap".
n/portmap-5.0-i486-2.tgz:  Replaced /etc/rc.d/rc.portmap with /etc/rc.d/rc.rpc.
  This script will start rpc.portmap, rpc.lockd, and rpc.statd.  All of these
  are needed to make proper use of NFS from either the server or client side,
  so this approach should be more likely to work out of the box.  Note that
  nfs-utils will also be required in order to use rc.rpc or NFS, even as a
  client.  If rc.rpc is needed, another script will run it as long as it is
  readable.  The only reason to make rc.rpc executable would be to run it at
  boot time when there are no shares in /etc/exports and no mounts in
  /etc/fstab, but you wish to be able to mount NFS partitions manually.
  Thanks to Arno G. Schielke and Cesar Suga for suggesting this idea.
n/tcpip-0.17-i486-39.tgz:  Don't allow dhcpcd -k to make noise at shutdown
  time if dhcpcd is not running (as in cases where it was shut down manually,
  or the lease time was infinite).
  Added support in rc.inet1 and rc.inet1.conf for adjustable DHCP_TIMEOUT.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
x/ttf-indic-fonts-0.4.7.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Added TTF fonts for displaying Indic
  scripts.  This package supports Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Kannada,
  Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu.
  For information about fully enabling Indic support (including input), see:
    /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/Indic-Fonts-HOWTO.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Patched installer's network script to look for
  network26.dsk if 2.6.17.13 (huge26.s) is used to boot/install.
  Thanks to Piter Punk for work done (long ago) to fix probing for 2.6 modules.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for helping debug loopback mounts in the installer
  when using the 2.6.17.13 (huge26.s) kernel.
  NFS installs with the test26.s kernel are not supported by this system,
  but should work if you put the module(s) you need on a floppy or otherwise
  make them available and load them manually.
isolinux/network26.dsk:  Added network26.dsk for NFS installs with huge26.s.
  Don't try to put this one on a floppy disk, folks.  ;-)
kernels/huge26.s/*:  Added built-in NLS (CONFIG_NLS_CODEPAGE_437,
  CONFIG_NLS_ISO8859_1, and CONFIG_NLS_UTF8) to allow FAT filesystems to
  loopback mount for NFS installs.
kernels/test26.s/*:  Added 2.6.18 test26.s kernel.
rootdisks/install.1:  Patched installer's network script.
rootdisks/install.2:  Rebuilt.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Patched installer's network script.
testing/packages/flex-2.5.33-i486-1.tgz:  Added flex-2.5.33.
  Requested by Alberto Simões.
testing/packages/gutenprint-5.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added gutenprint-5.0.0.
  This package was formerly known as "gimp-print", and will likely take the
  place of gimp-print in the AP series after going through testing.
  Suggested by Stefano Vesa.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.18/kernel-generic-2.6.18-i486-1.tgz:
  Added Linux 2.6.18 generic kernel.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.18/kernel-headers-2.6.18-i386-1.tgz:
  Added Linux 2.6.18 kernel headers.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.18/kernel-modules-2.6.18-i486-1.tgz
  Added Linux 2.6.18 kernel modules.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.18/kernel-source-2.6.18-noarch-1.tgz
  Added Linux 2.6.18 kernel source.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 19 18:13:09 CDT 2006
l/arts-1.5.4-i486-2.tgz:  Patched an annoying bug where audio programs such
  as ogg123 would not work unless KDE had been run first.  I took several
  stabs with me sword at ripping out kdebase's surprise HAL requirement as
  well, but the best I could achieve was "Internal Error".  Aarrr!!
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 19 14:07:49 CDT 2006
a/gzip-1.3.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gzip-1.3.5, and fixed a variety of bugs.
  Some of the bugs have possible security implications if gzip or its tools are
  fed a carefully constructed malicious archive.  Most of these issues were
  recently discovered by Tavis Ormandy and the Google Security Team.  Thanks
  to them, and also to the ALT and Owl developers for cleaning up the patch.
  For further details about the issues fixed, please see:

  (* Security fix *)
n/procmail-3.22-i486-2.tgz:  Added support for large (2GB+) mailboxes.
  Thanks to Dominik L. Borkowski.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Patched installer to allow splitting a package series
  over two or more pieces of optical media.  If a package directory contains
  a file named README_SPLIT.TXT, then it will be continued on the next disc.
  An example of such a file can be found in /isolinux.
  Thanks very much to Eric Hameleers for the initial patch and testing!
rootdisks/install.1:  Rebuilt.
rootdisks/install.2:  Patched to allow a split package series.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Patched to allow a split package series.

Mon Sep 18 15:18:07 CDT 2006

  Thanks much to Mircea Baciu!

Mon Sep 18 05:33:24 CDT 2006
Slackware 11.0 release candidate 5.  This is the last one, scout's honor.
a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-9.tgz:  Stripped /lib/libbz2.so.1.0.3, added
  /lib/libdm.so.0.0.4.
a/bzip2-1.0.3-i486-3.tgz:  Stripped /lib/libbz2.so.1.0.3.
ap/espgs-8.15.3svn185-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to espgs-8.15.3svn185.
  OK, I don't like using repo versions at all, much less inserting them at the
  last second.  But, it seems like par for the course for ghostscript and its
  offshoots where there wasn't much choice about shipping 8.15rc4 in Slackware
  10.2.  In this case, building from svn fixes two critical problems:  missing
  support for CJK, and not correctly printing Umlauts with certain fonts.
  Thanks to Shin-ichi Abe and Matthias Bachert.
  If this version of espgs creates new problems that are worse than these,
  please let me know as soon as possible.  It's tested here and seems stable.
ap/vim-7.0.109-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.0.109.
d/subversion-1.4.0-i486-1.tgz:  After a couple convincing assurances that this
  was a safe and ABI/API compatible upgrade, I decided to allow this upgrade.
  Thanks to Malcolm Rowe and Janusz Dziemidowicz.
l/desktop-file-utils-0.11-i486-1.tgz:  Added desktop-file-utils-0.11.
  The next XFce will need this freedesktop.org package.
  Thanks to Robby Workman for the information.
l/libexif-0.6.13-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed libexif.pc includedir.
  Thanks to Charles Shannon Hendrix for pointing this out.
l/libtheora-1.0alpha7-i486-1.tgz:  Added libtheora-1.0alpha7.  This links with
  (as far as I know) optional plugins only and is a safe last-second addition.
  Furthermore, the Theora team has promised that files encoded with this
  version of the codec will always be playable.  The format is stable and ready
  for production use, so keeping it out of 11.0 due to the "alpha" would be
  plain silly.  Suggested by Edo Hikmahtiar, and Diogo R.
l/libungif-4.1.4-i486-3.tgz:  Added the utilities in /usr/bin, some of which
  are used to detect that annoying image spam that's on the rise...
  Thanks to Joran Kvalvaag.
l/neon-0.25.5-i486-1.tgz:  Added neon package, split from subversion-deps-1.4.0.
x/dejavu-ttf-2.10-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dejavu-ttf-2.10.
xap/vim-gvim-7.0.109-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.0.109.
  Once again, this is just an add-on for the VIM package in ap.  :-)
xap/xine-lib-1.1.2-i686-2.tgz:  Recompiled against libtheora to include the
  Theora codec plugin.  Theora testsuite passed.
xap/xine-ui-0.99.4-i686-3.tgz:  Patched an issue where xine-ui could block
  input to Konsole.  Thanks to Nuts Mueller.
extra/linux-smp-2.6.17.13/kernel-headers-smp-2.6.17.13-i386-1.tgz:
  Fixed slack-desc typo.  No actual rebuild, so no -$BUILD bump.
  Thanks to David Somero.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Fixed swap setup in the "Cancel" or unselecting all swap
  partitions case.  Thanks to Marcus Moeller.
rootdisks/install.1:  Rebuilt.
rootdisks/install.2:  Fixed swap setup.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Fixed swap setup.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep 16 23:08:49 CDT 2006
l/libgpod-0.3.2-i486-2.tgz:  Added --enable-eject-command and
  --enable-unmount-command.  Thanks to Kody K.
kde/amarok-1.4.3-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with a patch to fix non-latin1
  playlist corruption by forcing UTF8.
  Thanks to guilherme and the kind folks on #amarok.
  Added explicit --emable-libgpod.  Thanks to Kody K.
kde/kdeutils-3.5.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed ark crash due to race condition on SMP
  machines.  Thanks to JaguarWan.
n/rdesktop-1.5.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to rdesktop-1.5.0.
  Thanks to Andrew Fuller for pointing it out.
x/x11-6.9.0-i486-11.tgz:  Fixed an overflow in CID encoded Type1 font parsing.
  For further reference, see:

  Also, fixed French Canadian keymap variant.  Thanks to Patrice Tremblay.
x/x11-devel-6.9.0-i486-11.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/x11-xdmx-6.9.0-i486-11.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/x11-xnest-6.9.0-i486-11.tgz:  Recompiled.

extra/linux-smp-2.6.17.13/kernel-generic-smp-2.6.17.13-i686-1.tgz:
  This is an optional kernel with support for SMP (up to 16), dual core
  optimizations, and SMT (Hyperthreading).  Fully tuned and ready to go.
extra/linux-smp-2.6.17.13/kernel-headers-smp-2.6.17.13-i386-1.tgz
  Optional kernel headers.  There will only be needed to compile a few things,
  such as apps and libraries that use ALSA (it contains the /usr/include/sound
  directory that for 2.4.x kernels is supplied in the alsa-driver package).
extra/linux-smp-2.6.17.13/kernel-modules-smp-2.6.17.13-i686-1.tgz:
  Kernel modules for Linux 2.6.17.13-smp, including ALSA modules.
  These install into /lib/modules/2.6.17.13-smp/.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep 14 19:41:22 CDT 2006
d/git-1.4.2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to git-1.4.2.1.
xap/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.7-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to firefox-1.5.0.7.
  This upgrade fixes several possible security bugs.

a/glibc-solibs-2.3.6-i486-6.tgz:  Recompiled.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-6.tgz:  Upgraded to tzcode2006k and tzdata2006k.
  Added "ldconfig -r ." to install script.  Thanks to Stuart Winter.
a/openssl-solibs-0.9.8b-i486-2.tgz:  Patched an issue where it is possible to
  forge certain kinds of RSA signatures.  The patch is used instead of an
  upgrade to openssl-0.9.8c as it was issued later with a corrected fix.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339
  (* Security fix *)
a/udev-097-i486-10.tgz:  If there's no udevd daemon, don't allow rc.udev to
  try to start.  Thanks to Eugene Crosser.
d/pkgconfig-0.21-i486-3.tgz:  Added {curly brackets} around PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  in /etc/profile.d/pkgconfig.*.  Thanks to Rémy Pagniez.
l/glibc-2.3.6-i486-6.tgz:  Recompiled against 2.4.33.3 and 2.6.17.13 headers.
  (these kernel versions are now "golden" for release)
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.6-noarch-6.tgz:  Recompiled.
l/glibc-profile-2.3.6-i486-6.tgz:  Recompiled.
n/openssl-0.9.8b-i486-2.tgz:  Patched an issue where it is possible to

kernels/huge26.s/*:  Added NFSv3 support.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 12 06:29:32 CDT 2006
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-67.tgz:  Sleep 3 seconds before mounting non-root
  partitions.  This was a sleep that I'd removed earlier in the devel cycle to
  see what it would break (if anything), and the answer is some external hard
  drives that take a couple seconds to hotplug.  Thanks to Fabio Busatto.
  In rc.M, restart udevd when returning from single user mode.
  Thanks to James Michael Fultz.
  Patched initscript.5 man page to show proper /sbin/initscript path.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
  Found another assumption that the kernel has hotplug support in the rc.udev
  stop function.  Thanks again to Gary Hawco for the original bug report.
a/udev-097-i486-9.tgz:  Uncommented dmsetup rule for LVM2 -- it doesn't seem
  to hurt anything.  Thanks to Dex Filmore.
ap/diffutils-2.8.1-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed sdiff.1 man page.
  Thanks to James Michael Fultz.
kde/amarok-1.4.3-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against new libmtp.
l/libmtp-0.0.18-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libmtp-0.0.18.
l/libwpd-0.8.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libwpd-0.8.6.
  Thanks to Eugene C. for the CXXFLAGS advice.
n/imapd-4.64-i486-3.tgz:  Added missing md5.txt mentioned in the imapd man
  page, plus a note about additional (large) documentation in the sources.
  The docs directory was also moved to /usr/doc/imapd4.64.
  Thanks to Mark Flacy for reminding me about this one.
n/rdesktop-1.4.1-i486-1.tgz:  Added rdesktop-1.4.1.  Yes, we're in release
  candidates, but if this doesn't work at least it is small.  :-)  I've had
  many, many requests, and it is needed by krdc, so that's my rationale.
  Oh -- and thanks to everyone for positive feedback on libgpod.  I also fixed
  the typo in my request for feedback below.  I hope that doesn't break too
  many ChangeLog parsing scripts...
n/stunnel-4.17-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to stunnel-4.17.
  Thanks to Cal Peake for the notice.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 11 02:10:19 CDT 2006
a/module-init-tools-3.2.2-i486-2.tgz:  In /etc/modprobe.d/, if there's no
  /etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf file, try to make a link to ../modprobe.conf.
  This will retain legacy support for existing /etc/modprobe.conf files.
  Thanks very much to Ivan Kalvatchev for persisting with this bug report
  until I finally saw the light of day.  :-)
l/libmtp-0.0.16-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed hotplug and udev support.
  Thanks to Carlos Corbacho for the help on this -- I knew it wasn't
  working yet and was hoping someone would step up.  Wow, that was fast!
l/libnjb-2.2.5-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed hotplug and udev support.
  Again, thanks to Carlos Corbacho.  Now my NJB3 works.  :-)
  Anyone have any yea/nay feedback on libgpod and amaroK?
+--------------------------+

extra/linux-2.6.17.13/kernel-source-2.6.17.13-noarch-1.tgz
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.17.13 kernel source.
  [ Andrea was asleep when I noticed these, and I didn't want to find out
    what happens when one wakes one's sleeping wife and asks her to start
    building kernels, so... ]
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep  9 01:18:53 CDT 2006
d/ruby-1.8.4-i486-2.tgz:  As it would so happen, ruby-1.8.5 fixes a security
  problem, but also breaks a considerable number of things, including Ruby on
  Rails (RoR being one of the biggest appeals of Ruby), and other applications
  that make interesting use of it.  So, for now anyway -- back to 1.8.4.
kde/amarok-1.4.3-i486-2.tgz:  This was the only thing that touched the tainted
  Ruby.  ;-)   Seriously, this will all get straightened out, but we have a
  release to do.  Should we wait for everyone to adopt the new Ruby API/ABI?
  Or must it be: "works" / "secure" -- pick one?  :-)  It's always best to use
  the right tool for the job or you can get hurt.  Remember shop class?
kde/kdesdk-3.5.4-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with configure flags that allow the
  apr libraries to be found.  Thanks to Giacomo Lozito.
y/bsd-games-2.13-i486-8.tgz:  "pom" now supports a reasonable number of digits
  with a command line option, as noted in the man page.  Default behavior has
  not been changed (it is still a rounded integer percentage).  My own patch
  didn't live long enough to see birth in a stable release, but who cares.  :-)
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers (who loves a good time-waster) for the better patch.
  I knew he wouldn't be able to resist this one.  ;->
bootdisks/raid.s:  Reverted to the old megaraid driver since regaraid2 is
  already in the scsi2.s bootdisk.
kernels/huge26.s/*:  Fixed USB keyboard support in the installer (at least
  tested on CD/DVD media).  Thanks to Bruce Hill, Jr. for pointing out that
  this was no longer working.
    Please note that if you install with this you still need kernel-modules
  from /extra, and that there's no alsa-driver for this kernel because it's
  all built into kernel-modules and kernel-headers (well, and the kernel :-).
  ALSA 1.0.11/12 specifically DO NOT support these newer kernels.  Check out
  the SUPPORTED_KERNELS file in the alsa-driver source.  Feel free to play
  with various combinations (many DO work, but without any noticable
  improvement to me).  I try very hard to not break your sound system, but
  I'm already bending the rules with alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.4.33.3...
  Also, if you find bugs in stuff I don't ship, contact the appropriate
  maintainer too, please.  I am not the hg repository for everything I ship.  
  (I know, I do look remarkably similar ;-)
  "Is this the spacecraft assembly building?"
kernels/raid.s/*:  Moved from the megaraid2 driver to the old megaraid
  driver, after it was pointed out that megaraid2 is already in scsi2.s.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep  7 22:59:40 CDT 2006
d/ruby-1.8.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ruby-1.8.5.
Honestly, I'm not sure these next three will help at the moment, but we're
laying some groundwork for later when HAL will take over (and sing "Daisy").
l/libgpod-0.3.2-i486-1.tgz:  Added libgpod-0.3.2.
l/libmtp-0.0.16-i486-1.tgz:  Added libmtp-0.0.16.
l/libnjb-2.2.5-i486-1.tgz:  Added libnjb-2.2.5.
kde/amarok-1.4.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to amarok-1.4.3.  Added plugins linked
  with libgpod, libmtp, and libnjb.  Working status (even with a bit of DYI) is
  not known (yet).  It might require HAL to make it do anything at all.
n/bind-9.3.2_P1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bind-9.3.2-P1.
  This update addresses a denial of service vulnerability.
  BIND's CHANGES file says this:
    2066.   [security]      Handle SIG queries gracefully. [RT #16300]
  The best discussion I've found is in FreeBSD's advisory, so here's a link:
    http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:20.bind.asc
  Also, fixed some missing man pages.  (noticed by Xavier Thomassin -- thanks)
  (* Security fix *)
y/bsd-games-2.13-i486-7.tgz:  Snipped part of a crufty old patch that wouldn't
  apply.   Added an (unapplied) patch to make pom give you two more digits of
  accuracy.  I didn't apply it since it wasn't quite done;  it should have the
  traditional default (no decimal places) that everyone is used to, and an
  arbitrary accuracy selectable with a command line switch.  Perhaps it should
  be rewritten to use gmp.  Oh, and the man page will then need fixing.
  Eric?  ;-)

a/udev-097-i486-8.tgz:  Fixed a missing '[' in rc.udev.  Thanks to
  guilherme for pointing out the error, and to J., who found the missing
  '['.  (It had fallen off my desk and ended up under a table)
kernels/System.map:  Forgot to gzip a bunch of these.  Thanks, Steve'o.

  I wasn't planning a Slackware 11.0 release candidate 4, but here we go.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.33.3-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 sata.i kernel.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.33.3-i486-1.tgz
  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 kernel modules.
a/udev-097-i486-7.tgz:  Make sure /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug exists before
  writing to it.  Thanks to Gary Hawco for the bug report.
  Change log level from "crit" or "err" since udev doesn't support "crit".
  Silly me, I saw some mention of syslog levels in the docs and assumed it
  supported all of them.  At least in unrecognized cases the default is "err"
  anyway, so this bug didn't cause ill effects.  Accuracy in documentation is,
  nevertheless, always a good thing to strive for.  (I'm referring here to
  my own inaccurate additions to udev.conf...)
  Thanks to Chris Vowden for pointing this out.
  Don't fail to mount tmpfs on /dev because some other tmpfs mount exists.
  Thanks to Ken Milmore for the patch.
  Forget standards -- if k3b wants "/dev/writer" then that is good enough
  justification for me.  Try to make a link to the most full-featured burner.
  Thanks to my good friend Dex Filmore.
  Relaxed the perms on input events from 600 to 640 so that members of group
  root can also read events.  Mode 644 was suggested, but wouldn't that let
  anyone on the box set up e.g. a keyboard logger?  It didn't seem secure to
  me, and 640 looks like a decent compromise.
  Thanks to Jon Anders Skorpen.
ap/mysql-5.0.24a-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mysql-5.0.24a.
  Evidently the ABI change in MySQL 5.0.24 was unintentional, so all the
  packages that were recompiled before need another recompile.  Oh well, maybe
  this little exercise has fixed something else we didn't know about.  :-)
d/kernel-headers-2.4.33.3-i386-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 kernel headers.
d/perl-5.8.8-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
k/kernel-source-2.4.33.3-noarch-1.tgz
  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 kernel source.
kde/koffice-1.5.2-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
kde/qt-3.3.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.4.33.3-i486-1.tgz:  Recompiled for Linux 2.4.33.3.
  By the way, I did try ALSA 1.0.12 and noticed that emu10k1 wasn't compiling
  for Linux 2.4.33.3.  I think we are probably safer sticking with the well
  tested ALSA 1.0.11 for the release.
n/bitchx-1.1-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
n/dhcp-3.0.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed incorrect man page permissions.
  Thanks to Jerome Pinot.
n/iptables-1.3.5-i486-2.tgz:  Updated a rather ancient description file.
  Thanks to Sean Donner for noticing that.  I hope the many folks still
  running Linux 2.2.x were adequately warned.
n/php-4.4.4-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
n/samba-3.0.23c-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.23c.
n/sendmail-8.13.8-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with official patch.
  "(2006-08-30) If sendmail is used with -bs and a mail filter (milter) is
   configured, an assertion can be triggered.  This patch fixes the bug."
  Thanks much to Jakub Jankowski for the heads up.
n/sendmail-cf-8.13.8-noarch-3.tgz
extra/ktorrent/ktorrent-2.0.2-i486-1.tgz:  Added ktorrent-2.0.2.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp for showing me this one.  I've always used the
  command line BT clients (usually in "screen"), but this is nice, doesn't
  require mainline BitTorrent or any non-KDE dependencies, and will work
  great for downloading (and seeding) Slackware ISO images.  :-)
extra/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.1pre25_2.4.33.3-i486-1.tgz:
  Recompiled for Linux 2.4.33.3.
extra/php5/php-5.1.6-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
bootdisks/*:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 kernels.
kernels/*:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.3 kernels, except the huge.s kernel.
  In raid.s, switch from the megaraid to megaraid2 driver.  This should
  support everything the old driver did and then some.  If there are
  problems, let me know ASAP.  Thanks to Michael Johnson.  
isolinux/initrd.img:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
  Eric Hameleers and I did a bit more work on the NFS installer (in the
  install.* rootdisks below, too).  Now installing via NFS will attempt
  to mount the root of the Slackware tree first, rather than only the
  /slackware directory within.  This (if successful), allows choosing
  a kernel to install later on, just like installing from CD, DVD, or
  hard drive.  If it doesn't work (perhaps only /slackware is exported)
  then the installer will fall back on the traditional behavior.
  Thanks to everyone who suggested this idea from time to time, and
  thanks to Eric for finally making it happen.
isolinux/network.dsk:  Upgraded network modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
isolinux/pcmcia.dsk:  Upgraded pcmcia modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
rootdisks/install.1:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
rootdisks/install.2:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
rootdisks/network.dsk:  Upgraded network modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
rootdisks/pcmcia.dsk:  Upgraded pcmcia network modules to Linux 2.4.33.3.
  I can be off topic here, right?
  BIG congratulations to my little sister Jennifer on the birth of her
  daughter Abigail Jane.  Mazel Tov!  :-)

a/util-linux-2.12r-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed incorrect permissions on /var/lock.
  Thanks to Steven Robson.
f/linux-howtos-20060829-noarch-1.tgz:  Updated the HOWTOs again.  I guess back
  in February this must have been looking ready to release.  ;-)
  Thanks to Szymczak Artur for noticing the HOWTOs were stale.
x/x11-6.9.0-i486-10.tgz:  Reverted the ATI hang patch after problem reports.
  If you were helped by the patch it'll be held in /extra for the release so
  that hopefully everyone can enjoy a working ATI card.  :-)
  Thanks again to Mark Canter, as this is a real problem but the patch does
  seem to introduce some new issues of its own.  It's good to have an
  alternate driver just in case, though.
x/x11-devel-6.9.0-i486-10.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/x11-xdmx-6.9.0-i486-10.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/x11-xnest-6.9.0-i486-10.tgz:  Recompiled.

  Thanks to Piter Punk.
extra/x11-radeon-patched/x11-radeon-patched-6.9.0-i486-1.tgz:
  Here's the patched radeon module from the -9 X.Org Slackware packages.
  There's a README file included with it explaining what it is for with
  references to a discussion of the issue.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Fixed an installer bug where setup would ask which
  swap partitions you'd like to use and then conveniently set them all up
  for you if you selected at least one.  Thanks to DEF.
rootdisks/install.1:  Fixed a bug where libraries that were moved to install.2
  to make space on install.1 were needed by /bin/mount.  Thanks to David Bray.
rootdisks/install.2:  Moved a couple of libraries to install.1.
  Fixed installer swap bug.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Fixed installer swap bug.
+--------------------------+
Sun Aug 27 05:36:53 CDT 2006
ap/vim-7.0.066-i486-2.tgz:  Use the default vanilla system vimrc as distributed
  with the vim sources.  Thanks to J for mentioning that using vim with
  'crontab -e' was working fine without any additions to the vimrc.
d/m4-1.4.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to m4-1.4.6.
l/libpng-1.2.12-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled so that libpng.so.* links to libz and
  libm.  This has been a point of contention for a long time with the PNG folks
  maintaining that you shouldn't have to link libpng this way.  Well, just
  about everyone else builds libpng to link with -lz and -lm automatically,
  but I've held my ground along with the PNG team (usually I will defer to
  upstream and will send people there with these kinds of requests).  Today
  Janusz Dziemidowicz pointed out that if you build libpng with ./configure
  that now it *is* linking to these.  Good enough reason to end this problem
  right now.  Thanks Janusz, for pointing out that discrepancy and sending in
  a patch.  :-)
n/irssi-0.8.10a-i486-4.tgz:  Removed duplicates and unformatted files from
  docs/help directory.  Thanks to James Michael Fultz.
x/dejavu-ttf/dejavu-ttf-2.9-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dejavu-ttf-2.9.
  Moved from /extra into the X series.
  Thanks to the DejaVu team (http://dejavu.sf.net) for the superb work.
x/fontconfig-2.2.3-i486-2.tgz:  Patched /etc/fonts.conf to favor the DejaVu
  fonts over the Vera ones if they are present on the machine.  US English
  users should notice only minor (if any) differences with this patch,
  but other users could see their language displayed properly out-of-the box
  for the first time.  :-)
x/x11-6.9.0-i486-9.tgz:  Patched a PCF font parsing bug that could crash X.
  Fixed the Greek keyboard layout.  Thanks to Thanos Kyritsis.
  Fixed ATI lockup bugs.  Thanks to Mark Canter.
x/x11-devel-6.9.0-i486-9.tgz:  Recompiled.

xap/vim-gvim-7.0.066-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
extra/lvm2/device-mapper-1.02.09-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to
  device-mapper-1.02.09, moved out of /testing.
extra/lvm2/lvm2-2.02.09-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to LVM-2.02.09,
  moved out of /testing.

  moved out of /testing.

Fri Aug 25 04:35:22 CDT 2006
Here is Slackware 11.0 release candidate 3.  I think most of the irresistible
  upgrades are in here now, and the bug reports have been mostly handled.
  There may still be a few changes, and possibly another release candidate,
  but this is pretty close to final with the exception of updating
  documentation and building ZipSlack.  Thanks very much to everyone who is
  helping to test these release candidates -- I think this is going to be a
  very up to date and stable release.  :-)
a/glibc-solibs-2.3.6-i486-5.tgz:  Patched an issue with kernel version parsing
  in ld-2.3.6.so that was leading glibc to treat 2.4 kernels with 4 version
  parts (such as 2.4.33.2) as if they supported NPTL, leading to a crash
  at boot.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-5.tgz:  Updated timezone information from
  tzdata2006j.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.33.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to 2.4.33.2 sata.i kernel.
  Enabled support for OOM killer and HIGHMEM4G.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.33.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.2 modules.
a/udev-097-i486-6.tgz:  Restore ttyUSB access to members of the tty group.
  Thanks to Eugene Crosser.
  In rc.udev, ignore lines that start with '#'.
  Thanks to Ian Bates.
  Removed hostap and hostap_cs dupes from blacklist.
  Thanks to giovanni quadriglio.
  Patched rc.optical-symlinks to avoid error messages with real SCSI devices
  and the SCSI generic driver.
  Thanks to Lorenzo Buzzi.
ap/lm_sensors-2.10.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added lm_sensors-2.10.0, which contains the
  libsensors library that KDE can use for hardware status monitoring.
ap/vim-7.0.066-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim 7.0.066.
  Added reasonable default vimrc if none exists.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
xap/vim-gvim-7.0.066-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gvim 7.0.066 (requires vim).
d/kernel-headers-2.4.33.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.2 headers.
d/perl-5.8.8-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to DBD-mysql-3.0006 and DBI-1.52.
  Eugene Crosser reported that DBD compiled against an older version of
  libmysqlclient no longer worked without a recompile.  Just to be on the
  safe side, everything linked with libmysqlclient is getting recompiled.
d/pkgconfig-0.21-i486-2.tgz:  Export PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
k/kernel-source-2.4.33.2-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.2 source.
  Enabled support for OOM killer and HIGHMEM4G in default .config.

kde/kdebase-3.5.4-i486-6.tgz:  Recompiled to use libsensors with ksysguardd.
  Fixed location of kdeglobals, removed font defaults but kept the
  anti-aliasing fixes.
kde/koffice-1.5.2-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient and libruby.
kde/qt-3.3.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient, added symlink
  in /usr/lib/pkgconfig to qt-mt.pc.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.4.33.2-i486-1.tgz:  Recompiled for Linux 2.4.33.2.
l/glibc-2.3.6-i486-5.tgz:  Patched an issue with kernel version parsing in
  ld-2.3.6.so that was leading glibc to treat 2.4 kernels with 4 version parts
  (such as 2.4.33.2) as if they supported NPTL, leading to a crash at boot.
  Added sa_IN and ru_RU.CP1251 locale support.
  Updated timezone information from tzdata2006j.
  Updated timezone utilities from tzcode2006j.
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.6-noarch-5.tgz:  Rebuilt.
  Added sa_IN and ru_RU.CP1251 locale support.
l/glibc-profile-2.3.6-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled.

l/libvisual-0.4.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added libvisual-0.4.0.  Just the library for
  now (no plugins), but this should make it much easier to compile and use
  audio visualization plugins without having to recompile amaroK.
n/bitchx-1.1-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
n/openldap-client-2.3.27-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openldap-client-2.3.27.
n/php-4.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against libmysqlclient.
t/tetex-3.0-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against new LessTif to stop warnings
  from xdvi.
t/tetex-doc-3.0-i486-4.tgz:  Rebuilt.  Moved info pages to /usr/info.
  Thanks to Kris Karas for pointing out the misplaced info pages.
xap/gimp-2.2.13-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-2.2.13.
extra/3dfx-glide/*:  Removed, as it most likely doesn't work.
extra/k3b/k3b-0.12.17-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-0.12.17.
extra/k3b/k3b-i18n-0.12.17-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-i18n-0.12.17.

  Recompiled for Linux 2.4.33.2.
extra/slackpkg/slackpkg-2.08-noarch-3.tgz:  Upgraded to slackpkg-2.08-noarch-3.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.
bootdisks/*:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.2 kernels.

isolinux/network.dsk:  Upgraded network modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
isolinux/pcmcia.dsk:  Upgraded pcmcia modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
rootdisks/install.1:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
rootdisks/install.2:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Upgraded USB/IEEE1394 modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
rootdisks/network.dsk:  Upgraded network modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
rootdisks/pcmcia.dsk:  Upgraded pcmcia network modules to Linux 2.4.33.2.
kernels/*:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33.2 kernels, except the huge.s kernel.

After much thought and consultation with developers, it has been decided to
move 2.6.17.x out of /testing and into /extra.  It runs stable by all reports,
has better wireless support, and is not going to be stale as soon.  In
addition, HIGHMEM4G has been enabled.  This caused no problems with my old
486 with 24MB (the one I use for compiling KDE ;-), and Tomas Matejicek has
enabled this in SLAX for a long time with no reports of problems, so I
believe it is a safe option (and is needed by many modern machines).
Thanks again to Andrea for building these kernels and packages.  :-)

kernels/huge26.s/*:  Upgraded huge26.s kernel to 2.6.17.11.
extra/linux-2.6.17.11/kernel-generic-2.6.17.11-i486-1.tgz:

  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.17.11 kernel modules.
  Load PC speaker support in rc.modules.  Thanks to NetrixTardis.
extra/linux-2.6.17.11/kernel-source-2.6.17.11-noarch-1.tgz
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.17.11 kernel source.

  Thanks to Richard Fuller for the fix.
+--------------------------+
Sun Aug 20 23:45:58 CDT 2006
a/gpm-1.20.1-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to send all non-critical error messages to
  the system logs rather than to the console.
a/pkgtools-11.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Merged in some more xorgsetup patches from
  Irfan Acar, Daniil Bratashov, and Piter Punk.
a/shadow-4.0.3-i486-12.tgz:  Patched for gcc-3.4.x.
  Thanks to Dominik L. Borkowski for the patch.
  Removed spurious id.1.gz manpage.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
  Removed obsolete options from the passwd program.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-66.tgz:  In rc.M, fixed the nohotplug cmdline option.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
  Sleep for a couple seconds after shutting down dhcpcd in rc.6 to allow time
  for various files in /etc to restore themselves.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
  Don't try to mount usbfs if it's in /proc/mounts already.
a/tar-1.15.1-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to be less strict about the option order.
  Thanks to Jonathan A. Irwin for sending me a patch from Sergey Poznyakoff.
a/udev-097-i486-4.tgz:  Changed default udev log level from err to crit.
  Refuse to run udev unless the kernel is 2.6.15+.  Thanks to Sean Donner.
a/util-linux-2.12r-i486-2.tgz:  Added schedutils-1.5.0 which is apparently due
  to be merged into util-linux upstream sometime soon anyway.
  Thanks to Jonathan Woithe for the suggestion.
ap/diffutils-2.8.1-i486-2.tgz:  Patched a bug in sdiff.
  Thanks to James Michael Fultz for the patch and improved build script.
ap/vim-7.0.063-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim 7.0.063.
  Removed unpopular libruby dependency.  :-)
e/emacs-21.4a-i486-3.tgz:  Avoid a package file overlap between Emacs ctags and 
  Exuberant Ctags.  Thanks to Michal Kowalski for pointing it out.
kde/kdebase-3.5.4-i486-5.tgz:  Added /opt/kde/share/kdeglobals to set the Vera
  fonts with anti-aliasing enabled as the defaults.
xap/seamonkey-1.0.4-i486-2.tgz:  Added /usr/lib/seamonkey -> 
  /usr/lib/seamonkey-1.0.4 symlink.  Thanks to Tsomi.
xap/vim-gvim-7.0.063-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim 7.0.063.
  Removed unpopular libruby dependency.  :-)
extra/checkinstall/checkinstall-1.6.0-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed 640 perms on FAQ.
  Thanks to Michael Iatrou.
rootdisks/pcmcia.dsk,isolinux/pcmcia.dsk:  Added ide-cs module.
  Requested by Zack Smith.
+--------------------------+
Sat Aug 19 23:58:27 CDT 2006
This is mostly frozen now unless bugs (or irresistible upgrades) come up, so
I'll call this update Slackware 11.0 release candidate 2.  :-)
a/kernel-ide-2.4.33-i486-2.tgz:
  Switched to the sata.i kernel which supports both parallel and serial ATA.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.33-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33 kernel modules.
d/pkgconfig-0.21-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pkg-config-0.21.
  Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to search in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig and

d/kernel-headers-2.4.33-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.
k/kernel-source-2.4.33-noarch-2.tgz:
  Updated the default .config to include SATA support.
  Oh, and yes I did see 2.4.33.1.  Thanks for letting me know ;-), but that
  kernel does not seem to be booting here so I'll stick with 2.4.33 for now.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.4.33-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.11 compiled for Linux 2.4.33.

bootdisks/speakup.s:  Added SATA support.
kernels/huge26.s/*:  Recompiled.
kernels/sata.i/*:  Recompiled.
kernels/speakup.s/*:  Added SATA support.
kernels/test26.s/*:  Upgraded test26.s kernel to 2.6.17.9.
To be consistent, bumped the build number on all of the 2.6.16.27 packages to -5.
extra/linux-2.6.16.27/alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.6.16.27-i486-5.tgz:
  Recompiled.
extra/linux-2.6.16.27/kernel-generic-2.6.16.27-i486-5.tgz:
  Recompiled.
extra/linux-2.6.16.27/kernel-headers-2.6.16.27-i386-5.tgz:
  Rebuilt.
extra/linux-2.6.16.27/kernel-modules-2.6.16.27-i486-5.tgz:
  Enabled CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_RELAXED_CAP_CHECK option so that
  Piotr Wierzchowski's Thinkpad will run cooler and use less power.  :-)
extra/linux-2.6.16.27/kernel-source-2.6.16.27-noarch-5.tgz:
  Rebuilt with CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_RELAXED_CAP_CHECK=y in .config.

  Thanks to Andrea for building the 2.6.17.9 kernels.
rootdisks/install.1:  Updated.  Thanks to Cal Peake for the idea about how to
  improve the setup of swap partitions.
  Updated most of the binaries on the installer, but not busybox.  It seems
  to be working fine, and the idea of messing with it now scares me.  ;-)
rootdisks/install.2:  Updated.
rootdisks/install.zip:  Updated.
rootdisks/network.dsk:  Fixed to probe for tg3 cards.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers and Bruce Hill, Jr.

  be used to crash programs linked to libtiff or possibly to execute code
  as the program's user.  A low risk command-line overflow in tiffsplit was
  also patched.

+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 15 01:20:55 CDT 2006
a/devs-2.3.1-noarch-24.tgz:  Added udev-style /dev/md/* devices to save people
  who boot between 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels some trouble.
  Thanks to Mircea Baciu for pointing out this possibility.
  Note:  Upgrading the devs package while running udev will NOT work.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-63.tgz:  Patched rc.4 to check both /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
  for gdm.  Thanks to Scott J. Harmon.
  Added a warning in rc.S that if you make an rc.modules.local that the other
  rc.modules script(s) will not be run.
  Don't try to start udev if sysfs and tmpfs are not in the kernel.
  Use grep '-q' option instead of '> /dev/null' in many places.

There are still a few changes yet to happen, but let's call this 
  Slackware 11.0 release candidate 1.  :-)

a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-4.tgz:  Updated to tzcode2006i and tzdata2006g.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.33-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33 bare.i kernel.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.33-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33 kernel modules.
a/udev-097-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-097.
  Updated the rc.optical-symlinks script.
  Added locking to cdrom-symlinks.sh and nethelper.sh scripts to avoid race
  conditions at boot time.  Thanks to Piter Punk.
  Fixed bugs in rc.udev where the script attempts to mount devpts and usbfs
  even if they are already mounted.  Thanks to Gunnar Florus Johansen.
d/kernel-headers-2.4.33-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33 kernel headers.
k/kernel-source-2.4.33-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.33 kernel source.

  kernel headers.
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.6-noarch-4.tgz:  Rebuilt.
l/glibc-profile-2.3.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled.
l/jre-1_5_0_08-i586-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard Edition
  Runtime Environment Version 5.0, Release 8.

+--------------------------+
Sat Aug 12 01:14:17 CDT 2006
a/hotplug-2004_09_23-noarch-9.tgz: Skip rc.hotplug if a new enough udev
  is running on a 2.6 kernel.  No wonder the boot time didn't seem faster!  :-)
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-62.tgz: If udev hasn't made /dev/cdrom and other symlinks,
  call a script from rc.M to make them.
  Added support to rc.K and rc.6 for an /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown script.
  Thanks to Robert Boucher for the idea.
  Rob McGee and others have made similar requests before...  thanks to all!
a/udev-096-i486-4.tgz:  Generate network card naming rules in
  /etc/udev/rules.d/network-devices.rules, but comment them out.  I think
  these additions are not quite reliable enough in all cases to be the default
  for the Slackware 11 release (of course, you have udev occasionally detecting
  multiple network cards in a different order, and so on some router machines
  these rules will be needed).  Or, you could run a 2.4.x kernel. ;-)
  If your system is naming network devices strangely you should delete your
  existing /etc/udev/rules.d/network-devices.rules and reboot.  If that doesn't
  do the trick you'll probably need to edit the file.
  Instead of having udev make the CD/DVD symlinks, have a new script called
  /lib/udev/rc.optical-symlinks do it.  If you'd rather use Piter Punk's method
  (which works better for hotplugging USB optical drives, for example), then
  just comment/uncomment the appropriate rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules.
n/whois-4.7.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to whois-4.7.15.
  Thanks to Gianluca Varisco for pointing out the new release.
xap/gimp-2.2.12-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed broken gimptool man page symlink.
+--------------------------+
Fri Aug 11 03:18:18 CDT 2006
a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-7.tgz:  Fixed libmm perms and location.
  Thanks to Fred Emmott.
  Upgraded libmm to 1.4.1.
  Reverted to CUPS libraries from 1.1.23.
a/cups-1.1.23-i486-3.tgz:  Reverted to cups-1.1.23 due to some applications
  needing time to adjust to no longer having access to the private CUPS
  functions.  ;-)  See below for more info.
a/etc-5.1-noarch-13.tgz:  Upgraded /etc/services to include IPP (for CUPS) and
  other new services.  Thanks to Christophe Legras for reminding me to upgrade
  this file, and to Two Beans for mailing me a more recent copy.
l/hicolor-icon-theme-0.9-noarch-2.tgz:  Fixed slack-desc typo.
  Reported by Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.
l/mm-1.4.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mm-1.4.1.
  Looks like libmm was split out of the Apache package just in time.  ;-)
n/samba-3.0.23b-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against CUPS 1.1.23.
n/sendmail-8.13.8-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with DBROKEN_PTHREAD_SLEEP defined
  in site.config.m4, which fixes a problem with libmilter.a that can cause
  sendmail milters to be unstable.  Thanks to Jan Rafaj for reporting this
  bug, the fix, and for testing the problem so throughly.
n/sendmail-cf-8.13.8-noarch-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.
n/tcpip-0.17-i486-37.tgz:  Removed redundant copy of /etc/services.
testing/packages/cups-1.2.2/cups-1.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  It seems as if KDE might
  still not be 100% ready for CUPS 1.2.x, so we're going to move this into
  /testing again for the release, but by all means use it if it works for you.
  It did mostly work here, but the problems with using it with KDE are also
  reproducable.  Thanks to Thomas Hanslík for the information.  Anyway, I had
  my suspicions that *something* was going to have linked with private CUPS
  functions or that this might break something in some way, but I also knew
  this package would get better testing in slackware/a than in /testing.  :-)
  So, now we know that it's probably safer to wait on cups-1.2.x.
  Thomas also mentioned a workaround -- editing cupsd.conf to comment
  out this line:
    # Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 10 02:07:10 CDT 2006
a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-6.tgz:  Added libmm.
a/pkgtools-11.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Fixed xwmconfig to only recommend installed
  window managers.  Thanks to Leandro Toledo.
Merged in patches for xorgsetup to support choosing a keyboard model, layout,
  variant, and even automatically configuring a mouse scroll wheel!  :-)
  Thanks to Ismael Cortes for the patches.
l/gnome-icon-theme-2.14.2-noarch-1.tgz:  Added gnome-icon-theme-2.14.2.  It
  seems that GTK+ applications such as Thunderbird use these, not just GNOME.  
l/gtk+2-2.8.20-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gtk+-2.8.20.
l/hicolor-icon-theme-0.9-noarch-1.tgz:  Added hicolor-icon-theme-0.9.
l/mm-1.4.0-i486-1.tgz:  Moved mm library out of the Apache package so that apps
  such as the standalone PHP interpreter can use it without installing Apache.
  Thanks to Robert Easter for the suggestion.
l/shared-mime-info-0.18-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to shared-mime-info-0.18.
n/apache-1.3.37-i486-2.tgz:  Removed mm-1.4.0 from the build directory and
  recompiled against the system mm package.  This now depends on having the
  mm package from the L series installed.
n/lftp-3.5.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lftp-3.5.4.
n/sendmail-8.13.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.8.
  That's what I get for trying to patch 8.13.7 myself last night.  ;-)
n/sendmail-cf-8.13.8-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.8 configs.
x/x11-6.9.0-i486-8.tgz:  More updates to the i945gm chipset support.

  Thanks to David Somero for pointing out this file.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Merged in many installer patches from Stuart Winter.

a/cups-1.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.2.2.
a/hdparm-6.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hdparm-6.6.
  Suggested by Janusz Dziemidowicz.
a/udev-096-i486-3.tgz:  In /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, change module name from
  i810_tco to i8xx_tco.  Thanks to Janusz Dziemidowicz.
  Piter Punk also wants me to remind everyone that this udev package requires
  a 2.6.15+ kernel or it will not work.  ;-)
ap/mc-4.6.1-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed PHP syntax highlighting.
  Thanks to Georgi Chorbadzhiyski for the patch.
n/samba-3.0.23b-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.23b.
n/sendmail-8.13.7-i486-2.tgz:  Applied two errata patches from sendmail.org.

x/x11-xvfb-6.9.0-i486-7.tgz:  Recompiled.
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug  8 00:55:52 CDT 2006
a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-4.tgz:  Added new version of libcurl.
a/etc-5.1-noarch-12.tgz:  Patched /etc/profile and /etc/csh.login to fix a bug
  where changing to another user with "su - someuser" would produce an error
  message such as "/dev/pts/2: Operation not permitted".
  Thanks to Menno Duursma for the fix.
a/findutils-4.2.28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to findutils-4.2.28.
a/gawk-3.1.5-i486-3.tgz:  Patched a fieldwidths bug.
  Thanks to Fabiano Caixeta Duarte for a pointer to the patch.
a/lilo-22.7.1-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed a typo in liloconfig where installing to the
  MBR was mentioned twice.  Thanks to Keith McGavin for pointing this out.
a/udev-096-i486-2.tgz:  Added the psmouse module to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
  so that /etc/rc.d/rc.modules can load it using the option "proto=imps".
  This change restores the mouse options used in Slackware 10.2.  At least on
  my machine, the default module options render the mouse completely unusable,
  but feel free to remove the module from the blacklist or configure rc.modules
  to your liking if this is not the ideal default for your machine.  
ap/mdadm-2.5.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mdadm-2.5.3.
  Thanks to James W. Laferriere and Gianluca Varisco for pointing this out.
kde/kdebase-3.5.4-i486-3.tgz:  Patched a bug involving external taskbars that
  expand as required to fit contents.  Thanks to Dirk Mueller for the patch.

There are a few reports that the newest udev is not friendly to some systems.
Well, that's progress for you -- it isn't always a smooth journey.  In most
cases the problems I've heard about could be fixed with a little bit of fine
tuning, such as blacklisting unwanted modules in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
and loading the desired replacements in /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.  However, in
case either of these older versions of udev worked better for you, they'll
be kept in /extra for a while as alternates.  Be aware that new kernels will
soon require the latest udev, though...
extra/udev-alternate-versions/udev-064-i486-2.tgz:  Added alternate udev-064.
extra/udev-alternate-versions/udev-071-i486-2.tgz:  Added alternate udev-071.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.17.8/kernel-generic-2.6.17.8-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.17.8 generic kernel.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.17.8/kernel-headers-2.6.17.8-i386-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.17.8 kernel headers.

a/pcmciautils-014-i486-1.tgz:  Added pcmciautils-014, needed to configure PC
  cards on systems running 2.6.x kernels.
a/sysfsutils-2.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Added missing libsysfs.so symlink.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-61.tgz:  Merged Piter Punk's changes for the new udev.
  Please make sure to move all the .new files in /etc/rc.d/ into place for
  this to work correctly!
a/udev-096-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-096.
  Thanks to Piter Punk for his great work to get this just exactly perfect.
a/grep-2.5-i486-3.tgz:  Improved build script and rebuilt.  I considered using
  grep-2.5.1a, but found some problem reports concerning it and decided such
  an upgrade would be best left for the next -current.  There have been no
  bug reports here concerning grep-2.5, so I see no reason to fix that which
  does not appear to be broken.  It's more important to have a known to be
  stable grep than it is to have the latest version, IMHO.
a/pciutils-2.2.3-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed missing pci/types.h header file.
  Thanks to Konrad Rzepecki.

Sat Aug  5 23:22:13 CDT 2006
a/usbutils-0.72-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to usbutils-0.72, patched to add
  back usbmodules since hotplug will need it for as long as the 2.4.x
  kernel is supported.
ap/mdadm-2.5.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mdadm-2.5.2.
ap/mysql-5.0.24-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mysql-5.0.24.

a/pciutils-2.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pciutils-2.2.3.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for the encouragement.  :-)
a/pcmcia-cs-3.2.8-i486-2.tgz:  Patched /etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia to work with either
  pcmcia-cs or pcmciautils.
a/sysfsutils-2.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added sysfsutils-2.0.0.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.
a/xfsprogs-2.8.10_1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xfsprogs-2.8.10-1.
  Thanks to Marco Berizzi for pointing out the new XFS programs.

  Thanks to Frédéric L. W. Meunier for the bug report and patch link.
l/freetype-2.1.9-i486-1.tgz:  Moved from the X to the L series.
  This makes more sense because freetype does not depend on any X11 libraries,
  and because PHP has now been built linked to libfreetype.
l/libusb-0.1.12-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libusb-0.1.12.
  Thanks to Gunnar Florus Johansen and CJ Johnson for the recommendation.
n/links-2.1pre23-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to links-2.1pre23.
n/php-4.4.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-4.4.3.
  From the announcement of the release:
     The security issues resolved include the following:
     * Disallow certain characters in session names.
     * Fixed a buffer overflow inside the wordwrap() function.
     * Prevent jumps to parent directory via the 2nd parameter of the
       tempnam() function.
     * Improved safe_mode check for the error_log() function.
     * Fixed cross-site scripting inside the phpinfo() function.
  The PHP 4.4.3 release announcement may be found on their web site:
    http://www.php.net
  NOTE:  Slackware's PHP package now requires the freetype library.
  (* Security fix *)
xap/xchat-2.6.6-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to fix Finnish translation errors.
  Thanks to C Johnson for pointing out that there was a new official patch.

+--------------------------+
Thu Aug  3 01:26:43 CDT 2006
a/gettext-0.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gettext-0.15.
  Thanks to steveo for noticing that this was missing from the ChangeLog.
a/lilo-22.7.1-i486-1.tgz:  Reverted to lilo-22.7.1 after reports from Aaron Lee
  and Philip Langdale that versions 22.7.2+ skip the boot menu on some machines.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-60.tgz:  Fixed rc.S to use /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local
  properly.  Bug reported by Dieter Rauschenberger, Ricardo García, and Luis.
  Use "/bin/sh" not "." to start rc.modules.local in case someone uses "exit".
  Merged more LVM changes from Cal Peake in rc.S and rc.M, including removing
  many uses of "sleep", so if anyone needed those let me know.
ap/at-3.1.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to at-3.1.10.  Added missing at_allow.5
  manpage.  Thanks to James Michael Fultz.
ap/cdparanoia-IIIalpha9.8-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to compile with gcc-3.4.6, and
  added a batch to the build directory for later that will use the 2.6.x
  kernel's SG_IO ioctl.  Thanks to Bradley Reed.
d/gettext-tools-0.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gettext-tools-0.15.
  Thanks to steveo for noticing that this was missing from the ChangeLog.
l/arts-1.5.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to arts-1.5.4.
kde/*:  Upgraded to KDE 3.5.4.  I know I told at least a few people that I
  wasn't planning on including this in Slackware 11.0 at the last minute,
  and there have been a couple of patches needed for it already.
  Please test quickly.  :-)
kdei/kde-i18n*:  Upgraded kde-i18n packages for KDE 3.5.4.
n/dnsmasq-2.32-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt after build script fixes from Fred Emmott
  (moving the chown -R), and some more from me.  Strangely, none of these
  fixes seemed to make any difference in the package that was output,
  but trust me, the build script is much better now.  :-)
n/gnupg-1.4.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnupg-1.4.5.
  From the gnupg-1.4.5 NEWS file:
    * Fixed 2 more possible memory allocation attacks.  They are
    similar to the problem we fixed with 1.4.4.  This bug can easily
    be be exploited for a DoS; remote code execution is not entirely
    impossible.
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug  1 19:04:52 CDT 2006
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-59.tgz:  In rc.S, give first priority to
  "rc.modules.local" if it exists.
  Try to shut down OpenLDAP in rc.6.  Thanks to Ricardson Williams.
  Merged some more LVM fixes into rc.6.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
d/autoconf-2.60-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to autoconf-2.60.
kde/qca-tls-1.0-i486-2.tgz:  Use the actual Qt installation path and not the
  /usr/lib/qt symlink or the qca-tls module will be erased if the Qt package
  is installed after this one (as happens in a new installation).
  Thanks to Richard Fuller for the bug report.
extra/checkinstall/checkinstall-1.6.0-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to checkinstall-1.6.0.
testing/packages/lvm2/device-mapper-1.02.08-i486-1.tgz:

Tue Aug  1 01:11:11 CDT 2006
a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Added /usr/lib/libslang.so.2.0.6.
a/bin-11.0-i486-3.tgz:  Removed /sbin/rescan-scsi-bus, which is better packaged
  along with the /etc/rc.d/rc.scanluns script in the sysvinit package.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-58.tgz:  Added symlinks for lastb.  Make the install
  script create /var/log/btmp if it doesn't already exist.
  Thanks to Menno Duursma, Tomas Matejicek, and Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi.
  Upgraded to the latest rescan-scsi-bus script.
  Thanks to Mircea Baciu for pointing it out.
  Use "tac" to deactivate LVM partitions in reverse order.
  Thanks to Luigi Genoni.
  Make sure usbfs gets mounted if it's in the kernel but hotplug is not used.
  Thanks to Cal Peake.
  If rc.M sees an executable rc.openldap, start it.
  Thanks to Christopher Linnet.
  In rc.scanluns, show the command that's being executed.
ap/jed-0.99_18-i486-3.tgz:  Relinked against libslang.so.2.0.6.  This does
  seem to be the path of least resistance.  :-)
d/subversion-1.3.2-i486-3.tgz:  Rebuilt to fix wrong file ownerships in the
  book included in the documentation.  Thanks to Philip Lyons.
kde/kdenetwork-3.5.3-i486-3a.tgz:  Patched for ICQ protocol changes.
kde/qca-1.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added qca-1.0.
kde/qca-tls-1.0-i486-1.tgz:  Added qca-tls-1.0.  This and the qca package are
  needed to support SSL connections with the Jabber(R) protocol in Kopete.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers, Markus Stauffer, and "--==HITMAN==--" for
  suggesting the addition of these QCA packages.
l/atk-1.10.3-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed slack-desc typo.  Thanks to Nick Chorley.
l/slang-2.0.6-i486-1.tgz:  Added slang-2.0.6.
l/slang1-1.4.9-i486-1.tgz:  Renamed from slang-1.4.9-i486-1.tgz.
n/irssi-0.8.10a-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed some strange directory permissions in the
  documentation directory.  Thanks to J.
tcl/tcl-8.4.13-i486-2.tgz:  Added /usr/include/tcl-private/{generic,unix}
  headers.  Thanks to Sergio Luis for recommending this, as there are some
  sources out there that require these header files.
+--------------------------+
Sun Jul 30 19:16:38 CDT 2006
n/samba-3.0.23a-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed bad symlink to "using_samba" in the docs.
  Thanks to Valentin Avram and William Hunt for reporting this.
ap/jed-0.99_18-i486-2.tgz:  Reverted to isearch.sl from jed-0.99_16.
  The version shipped in 0.99_18 seems to have problems unless jed is linked
  with slang-2, which we're putting off for a little while due to the major
  version bump and to let code that uses slang have a little time to catch up.
  Thanks to Luigi Genoni for the bug report and fix.
  Thanks as well to Petri Kaukasoina who also reported the problem.
ap/mysql-5.0.22-i486-2.tgz:  Reverted to MySQL-5.0.22.  Evidently MySQL-5.0.23
  was never officially released due to bugs, but made it to the mirror sites
  anyway.  Beat Vontobel's web site has some additional information about this:
    http://www.futhark.ch/mysql/148.html
  Thanks very much to Jakub Jankowski telling me the deal about 5.0.23.
ap/vim-7.0.042-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to ctags-5.6.
  Thanks to Michael Iatrou for pointing out the new ctags.
  Fixed a bug in the build script's patchlevel determination if $CWD contains
  a dot.  Thanks to Christophe Legras for the bug report and fix.
xap/vim-gvim-7.0.042-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.  Fixed a bug in the build script's
  patchlevel determination.  Thanks to Christophe Legras.
  Fixed an undefined variable in the vim-gvim build script.
  Thanks to Bryan Germann.

  rendering support for X.Org versions 6.9.0 and newer.
  Thanks to Marin Mitov.
  Specify the kernel version in the install script's depmod.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.

  packages.  See below for details.

  install script's depmod.  Thanks to Piter Punk.
l/apr-1.2.7-i486-1.tgz:  Added apr-1.2.7.  This is needed by subversion and
  other projects like Apache2.  Thanks to Eugene Crosser for the suggestion
  and detailed rationale behind not using the apr/apr-util in subversion.
l/apr-util-1.2.7-i486-1.tgz:  Added apr-util-1.2.7.
  This is needed by subversion and other projects.
n/bind-9.3.2-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with --enable-threads.
  Thanks to Marin Mitov for the suggestion.
xap/gxine-0.5.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gxine-0.5.7.

n/apache-1.3.37-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.37.
  From the announcement on httpd.apache.org:
    This version of Apache is security fix release only.  An off-by-one flaw
    exists in the Rewrite module, mod_rewrite, as shipped with Apache 1.3
    since 1.3.28, 2.0 since 2.0.46, and 2.2 since 2.2.0.
  The Slackware Security Team feels that the vast majority of installations
  will not be configured in a vulnerable way but still suggests upgrading to
  the new apache and mod_ssl packages for maximum security.
  For more details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3747

a/aaa_elflibs-11.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Refreshed libraries, added attr and acl.
a/lilo-22.7.2.1-i486-2.tgz:  OK, now the patch is actually applied.  :-)
  Thanks to arny -- I'm evidently too used to using "zcat" for patches.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i486-57.tgz:  Merged the following changes:
  Try to use a kernel specific rc.modules script if one is found.
  Added rc.scanluns to look for devices on non-zero LUNs.
  Shut down sshd in rc.6 so connections don't hang;
  Thanks to Michael Iatrou and Steven Saner for reporting this issue.
  Changed how LVM2 is deactivated in rc.6 (thanks to Cal Peake).
  Previously there were problems since / might have already been remounted as
  read-only before LVM2 was taken down.  Now I suspect there could be problems
  if the / is on LVM, so perhaps this is not the optimal solution...
  Umount CIFS filesystems in rc.6 (thanks to Jef Oliver).
  Umount NFS, SMB, and CIFS filesystems in rc.K;
  Thanks to Drew, and to Eric Hameleers for the bug reports.
  Fixed chown root:utmp in rc.S to use ':', not '.' (thanks to Adiel Mittmann).
  Remove saslauthd.pid (if present) in rc.S (thanks to Andy Preston).
  Stop saslauthd properly in rc.6 (thanks to Andy Preston).
  Don't shut down networking in rc.6 if / is on NFS (thanks to Luca Fabbro).
  Add a one second sleep after starting rc.udev.  According to Robby Workman
  this is just enough time for some slower devices to activate for mount.
  Load rc.keymap in rc.K (thanks to Ignacio Bermejo).
  Use "respawn" rather than "wait" for runlevel 4 (thanks to Wayne Marshall).
  Don't try to mount sysfs twice in rc.S (thanks to Moo).
d/python-2.4.3-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed build script bugs.  Thanks to Fred Emmott.
d/ruby-1.8.4-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with --enable-shared
  and --enable-install-doc.  Thanks to Fernando Lujan.
xap/fluxbox-1.0rc2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to fluxbox-1.0rc2.
  Thanks to Andrew Brouwers for letting me know about this.
xap/xchat-2.6.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xchat-2.6.6.  Thanks to CJ Johnson.

Wed Jul 26 01:55:38 CDT 2006
a/lilo-22.7.2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lilo-22.7.2.1.
  Thanks to James W. Laferriere for pointing out the patch.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.32-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed gzipped System.map.
a/udev-071-i486-2.tgz:  Applied pty patch from Ken Milmore.
  Fixed world writable documentation permissions reported by John Jenkins after

ap/vim-7.0.042-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to the latest patchlevel.
  Added many extra features.
  Thanks to Ricardo García for requesting omni completion for
  vim, which got me thinking about all kinds of ways to improve
  this and the (renamed) vim-gvim package. :-)
d/clisp-2.39-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to clisp-2.39 and libsigsegv-2.4.
d/git-1.4.1.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to git-1.4.1.1.

d/mercurial-0.9.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mercurial-0.9.1.
d/python-2.4.3-i486-3.tgz:  Merged the python, python-demo, and python-tools
  packages, bloating the python package by a whopping 2%!
d/ruby-1.8.4-i486-1.tgz:  Added Ruby since Amarok needs it...

l/libpng-1.2.12-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libpng-1.2.12.
  The libpng.so has gone .3 -> .0 -> .3.  I'll see what I can do about getting
  everything that's linked to .0 relinked with .3, as that's the major library
  number Slackware 10.2's libpng.so is using.  There is a .0 symlink to keep
  any code that was compiled while that was the number working just fine, but
  I will recompile a bunch of things mostly for the sake not using this link.
  It works either way, but I have an OCD about silly things like this.  ;-)

  Thanks to Jesper Juhl for the heads-up.
l/libtunepimp-0.4.2-i486-2.tgz:  Patched an overflow (CVE-2006-3600).
  Yes, there is libtunepimp-0.5.0.  Probably less supported by the existing
  codebase, and certainly not tested for as long.  We will wait for the next
  cycle on that, especially as it requires a couple of new dependencies.
  (* Security fix *)
  (-current only)
n/dhcpcd-2.0.4-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to move the pid/config directory back to
  /etc/dhcpc, since /var may not yet be mounted when dhcpcd is started.
  Issue noted by John Jenkins.

  Made a slight adjustment to rc.modules-2.6.16.27 to attempt to silence it
  when used on a machine running a 2.4.x kernel and without an activated
  parallel port.  I don't think it helped (or hurt) though...

Thanks again to Andrea for this batch of kernel packages, and also thanks
  for compiling all those intermediate kernels that were replaced upstream

We *are* getting closer to 11.0, friends.
I'm hoping for a larger changeset soon, but this should be fun to play with
for now as I work on the TODO list;  merging, compiling, and initial testing.
n/samba-3.0.23-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.23.
  This fixes a minor memory exhaustion DoS in smbd.
  The CVE entry for this issue may be found here:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3403
  (* Security fix *)
kernels/huge26.s/*:  Upgraded huge26.s kernel to 2.6.16.24.
  The name of the big kernel with many built-in options has been changed from
  test26.s to huge26.s to reflect that Slackware 11.0 will consider the
  2.6.16.x kernel series to be a supported kernel series.  However, I'm
  probably going to leave the bare.i 2.4.32 kernel as the default kernel (or
  perhaps sata.i?) as it has very good performance and probably better security
  due to the simpler and longer-tested design.  I might apply or at least make
  available in the kernel-source package for 2.4.32 a patch to fix direct
  rendering with 2.4.x kernels and X.Org 6.9.0 or newer.  Since anyone using
  Slackware for server use isn't likely to be loading the DRI modules, it's
  untouched code on those machines and won't affect server stability (well,
  depending on what, if anything, outside of the module is changed in the
  kernel).  It is probably a safe enough patch to apply.  I'd rather ship 100%
  vanilla kernels (and might, with the patch "on the side"), but DRI does not
  work without the patch past X.Org 6.8.2.  Is this enough text here?
  Perhaps I should rename this my "ChangeBlog".
Thanks to Andrea Volkerding for compiling these kernel packages:  :-)

  broken floppy support (e2fsck /dev/fd0).  Since there were no bug reports
  here regarding e2fsprogs-1.38 (other than it not being the latest version),

l/sdl-1.2.10-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with --disable-x11-shared to
  avoid problems with nVidia's drivers.
  Thanks to Giacomo Lozito for reporting this issue.
n/dhcpcd-2.0.4-i486-1.tgz:  Switched to dhcpcd version 2.0.4 after
  receiving some reports of problems with the latest version.  There
  were no reports of problems with dhcpcd-2.0.1 here, and it was only
  upgraded in order to have the new, shiny version.  But, rather than
  go all the way back to 2.0.1, we'll try 2.0.4 since one report was
  detailed enough to note that 2.0.4 worked while 2.0.6 didn't.
  Thanks to christian laubscher, Luca, and Dave Miller for providing
  useful data about these problems.
  In case anyone upstream is reading this, one of the problems was
  dhcpcd failing to work with the DHCP server built into the ZyXEL
  Prestige 650H-E1 router, and another issue was that after 2.0.4 it
  would no longer work with token ring.
  If any of these people have the time to test this new package and
  report success or failure, it would be appreciated.  :-)

  Fixes a potential denial of service problem caused by excessive recursion
  leading to stack exhaustion when attempting delivery of a malformed MIME
  message.  This crashes sendmail's queue processing daemon, which in turn
  can lead to two problems:  depending on the settings, these crashed
  processes may create coredumps which could fill a drive partition; and
  such a malformed message in the queue will cause queue processing to
  cease when the message is reached, causing messages that are later in
  the queue to not be processed.

  I considered using --prefix=/usr here since X.Org will be moving from
  /usr/X11R6 to /usr when Slackware absorbs the modular release, but I
  think it will be best to wait and make those changes all at once.
  This, BTW, will be sometime after the 11.0 release.  This current to
  stable cycle has already taken too much time (10.2 is in need of
  replacement), and introducing changes that might break things at this
  point would be foolhardy.  Although there's still quite a bit in the
  TODO queue here I'm making my steps carefully as -current is very
  stable, and I think it should ship as a stable 11.0 soon so that we can
  get back to the business of breaking things in -current.  :-)

  use dlopen() to link to the shared graphics libraries, as dlopen() wasn't
  working with the new PNG library.  Thanks to François Cojean and
  Raphaël Prevost for bug report and patch.

  Thanks to Simon Munton.
n/dhcpcd-2.0.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dhcpcd-2.0.6.
  Moved /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe to /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe-sample to prevent
  error messages in the log files.  The sources install this as non-
  executable, and there's little reason that I can see to use it in its
  default form as it only puts redundant information in the logs.
  It might be a useful stub for some other purpose though...
  Thanks to David Houlden and Luis for reporting the issue.

  and tree-1.5.0.  Removed sharutils, which are now in a separate package.
  Patched a security problem in zoo's fullpath() function that was reported by
  Jean-Sebastien Guay-Leroux.  At first this didn't seem like much as zoo is
  old and hardly used, but there are virus scanning programs that scan zoo
  archives.  It is a possible problem on any system running zoo like this in
  an automated way, and (of course) could also cause problems if a user were
  to open a malicious zoo archive manually.  (though I'd be pretty suspicious
  if someone were to mail me anything using "zoo" in 2006...)

  Moved jadetex out of this package and into the tetex package so that
  "mktexlslr" won't need to be run to find jadetex.

  Added --disable-a4, and fixed the texconfig for US paper default in the

  Merged jadetex into the teTeX package.
  Moved font build directory (only usable by root anyway) from
  /var/tmp/texfonts to /var/lib/texmf.
  Improved /tmp use security.
  Patched a possible security issue in library code borrowed from xpdf that's
  used in pdfetex.

  still try to use "mozilla" to open URLs.  Also, if Mozilla is not installed,
  then symlinks will be made in /usr/lib/pkgconfig/ from mozilla* ->

ap/mysql-5.0.21-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mysql-5.0.21.
  This fixes some security issues, including possible information leakage, and
  execution of arbitrary code.  Note that the information leakage bugs require
  that the attacker have access to an account on the database.  Also note that
  by default, Slackware's rc.mysqld script does *not* allow access to the
  database through the outside network (it uses the --skip-networking option).
  If you've enabled network access to MySQL, it is a good idea to filter the
  port (3306) to prevent access from unauthorized machines.

a/hotplug-2004_09_23-noarch-6.tgz:  Patched rc.hotplug.
  On 2.4 kernels use /sbin/hotplug for hotpluging, but on 2.6 kernels use
  /sbin/udevsend (if udev is being used) instead.  This should work better
  on systems using 2.6 kernels with udev and HAL.  Among the people pushing
  for this change for a while:  Jon Grosshart, Piter Punk, and Eugene Crosser.
  Blacklisted hw_random after reports that it causes some systems to crash.
  Note that rc.hotplug is now installed as rc.hotplug.new, but upgradepkg
  will still replace it for one more package iteration.  This will cause
  hotplug to be made executable on machines where it currently is not, so
  be aware of that.
a/slocate-3.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to slocate-3.1.
  This uses a new database format, so you'll have to wait for the cron job or
  run "updatedb -c /etc/updatedb.conf" as root.  Thanks to Piotr Simon and 
  Erik Jan Tromp for pointing out that the docs for the previous package were
  installed with incorrect permissions.
a/udev-071-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-071.
  Set ttyUSB devices to mode 660 so that users in group tty can use them.
  Get rid of the 10-udev.hotplug -> /sbin/udevsend symlink in
  /etc/hotplug.d/default.  This fixes a race condition with using the hotplug
  event handling system now enabled by default in the latest udev.rules.
  Another nice effect of this is that udevd no longer runs needlessly on 2.4
  systems.  WARNING: any existing udev.rules file will be overwritten, so save
  your old file if you have custom rules you'd like to merge in).
  Based on ideas suggested by Eugene Crosser, Piter Punk, and myself.
  In /etc/udev/scripts/make_extra_nodes.sh and floppy-extra-devs.sh, use
  ${udev_root} instead of hardcoding /dev.  Thanks to Andreas Schnaiter.
  In /etc/udev/scripts/make_extra_nodes.sh, fixed a bug that caused a bad
  cdrom -> pktcdvd/control symlink to be created if the pktcdvd driver was
  loaded prior to running the make_extra_nodes.sh script.
  Thanks to Kenneth Pettersen for the bug report and fix, and to Giovanni
  Quadriglio who also reported the issue.
  Finally, thanks to Piter Punk for his continued exploration of udev's
  bleeding edge.  What's going on there is quite interesting, but there are
  still some issues that have led me to decide it's best to take small steps
  in that direction.  For example, it was nice to be able to populate /dev
  before checking the partitions and mounting them read-write, and it seems
  that won't be possible any longer.  I've had other reports of hardware that
  wasn't hotplugged correctly, too (and ran into some myself).  Mostly it
  seems to be a question of figuring out the proper place in the boot process
  to put udev, but there are also a lot of things we're left to figure out
  concerning the udev rules.  We'll get there, but maybe not in the next
  release.  This upgrade to udev-071 meets the minimum requirement in the
  2.6.16.9 Documentation/Changes file, and has been heavily tested here and
  found to work well.  udev-090 boot the machine faster, but isn't as
  reliable (at least in testing here, with how it's called from our init
  scripts), and I've never been in favor of trading reliability for speed.
ap/alsa-utils-1.0.11-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-utils-1.0.11.
ap/mysql-5.0.20a-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mysql-5.0.20a.
d/guile-1.8.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to guile-1.8.0.
  I don't think anything in Slackware depends on guile any more, and that the
  only thing that ever did was a solitaire game in GNOME.  Since the GNOME
  distributions for Slackware are already including their own guile packages,
  I'm considering this package for removal.  How generally useful is it?
  Perhaps something like Ruby in the D series instead would be more useful.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.11_2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.11,
  compiled for Linux 2.4.32.
l/alsa-lib-1.0.11rc4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-lib-1.0.11rc4.
  The reason for 11rc4 rather than 11 is that there was a new subsystem added
  (src/pcm_rate_linear.c) in 11rc5, that I suspect causes aRts to break on
  at least one system using snd-via82xx and/or snd-ac97-codec -- aRts bails
  with a message about a CPU overload.  The exact chipset is:
  VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 60)
  It would seem to me that rc4->rc5 was kind of a risky time in the release
  cycle to introduce such a massive change to the codebase.  In any case,
  I think it's prudent to stick with alsa-lib-1.0.11rc4 as the default
  alsa-lib version until this gets sorted out upstream.
l/alsa-oss-1.0.11-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-oss-1.0.11.
l/libungif-4.1.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed libgif.so* symlinks.

xap/mozilla-1.7.13-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mozilla-1.7.13.
  This upgrade fixes several possible security bugs.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#mozilla
  This release marks the end-of-life of the Mozilla 1.7.x series:
    http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2006/04/12/sunset-announcement-for-fxtb-10x-and-mozilla-suite-17x/
  Mozilla Corporation is recommending that users upgrade to Firefox and
  Thunderbird, but if you're a fan of the style of the Mozilla Suite, I'd
  recommend SeaMonkey myself.  There's a good chance that Mozilla will not
  ship in the next Slackware release, and SeaMonkey will ship in its place.
  I'd been wondering which way to go with that, but getting an official
  EOL statement about the Mozilla Suite makes it seem like the switch to
  SeaMonkey should happen sooner rather than later.

extra/slacktrack/slacktrack-1.29-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to slacktrack-1.29-1.
testing/packages/alsa-lib-1.0.11-i486-1.tgz:  Added alsa-lib-1.0.11.  This is
  primarily intended for people to verify the issue with VIA sound, look for
  a similar issue with other chipsets as well (seems possible, since the issue
  isn't in any VIA specific code in alsa-driver), and report any useful
  information found to the upstream developers:
    https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/
  I reported the issue via (ha;) email, but not through the bug track system.
  The developer I contacted couldn't reproduce the issue and didn't think it
  had anything to do with the rate plugin additions.  If other folks test
  alsa-lib-1.0.11 and run into this, and have the time to jump through the
  hoops needed to report the bug at the URL above, I'd appreciate the help.
  At least it would demonstrate that it's not just my machine...

testing/packages/linux-2.6.16.9/kernel-source-2.6.16.9-noarch-1.tgz
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.16.9 kernel source.
  BTW, I think 2.6.16.x, being the first kernel series in the 2.6 series that
  has been promised some long-lived support, will be the 2.6 kernel you'll see
  in the next Slackware release.  If/when 2.6.17 (or 18, etc.) come out, don't
  expect to see me chasing after it immediately.  I'm looking for a kernel
  that can be counted on for stability -- not the bleeding edge.  Of course,
  once 2.6.16.x is considered tested enough to leave /testing (and it does
  seem close), perhaps a newer kernel might take its place here just for fun.
  Oh and yes -- I did see that 2.6.16.10 is out, and I know that the test26.s
  kernel wasn't yet updated.  Due to the Mozilla situation, I can't delay this
  update to be a $SUCKER some more, but you'll see 2.6.16.10 soon.  That is,
  if there isn't a newer one first...

In other news, I am aware of the expat-2.0 release, but this has a couple of
API changes (and a new major library number) and it will take some time for
upstream sources to patch for it.  Therefore, expat-2.0 will not be used for
Slackware 11.0 (but might be included in /testing).
There's also a new gmp-4.2, but the shared libraries that are built by this
have lower numbers than the ones from gmp-4.1.4, so that's probably not going
to make the cut this time around, either.

l/libmusicbrainz-2.1.2-i486-1.tgz:  Added libmusicbrainz-2.1.2, a library for
  searching a user-maintained community music metadatabase.  This is used
  to tag media files by libtunepimp.
l/libtunepimp-0.4.2-i486-1.tgz:  Added libtunepimp-0.4.2.  This is a library
  used to support adding metadata tags to music files using the MusicBrainz
  client libraries.  These libraries are used by several media players to look
  up track information.  (e.g. in Slackware, JuK and amaroK so far)
n/rp-pppoe-3.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to rp-pppoe-3.8.
xap/abiword-2.2.9-i486-1.tgz:  Removed.  More recent versions of AbiWord no
  longer support compiling without GNOME, and it looks like all of the GNOME
  distributions for Slackware are shipping GNOMEified (and newer) versions of 
  this package anyway.

n/samba-3.0.22-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.22.
  This fixes a security issue in previous samba releases where secret machine
  credentials may be written into a log file that is readable by anyone with
  a login account on the machine.  The issue affects only the samba-3.0.21
  series (including patches a, b, and c.)

a/aaa_base-10.2.0-noarch-4.tgz:  Chowned all binary directories to root:root.
  /media and /svc will not be added at this time, as /mnt (with subdirectory
  mount points such as /mnt/cdrom and /mnt/tmp) and /var were already
  perfectly adequate for the purposes for which /media and /svc were proposed.
  Polluting the root directory is, IMHO, completely pointless.  I suppose in
  the future that at least compatibility symlinks will need to be considered,
  though...
a/bash-3.1.014-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-3.1 patchlevel 014.
a/jfsutils-1.1.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to jfsutils-1.1.10.
a/module-init-tools-3.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to module-init-tools-3.2.2.
  This new version of module-init-tools has been patched to look for module
  configuration information in /etc/modprobe.conf only for 2.4.x kernels.
  For 2.6.x kernels, files found in the directory /etc/modprobe.d/ are used
  instead.  Eventually, /etc/modprobe.conf will be phased out in favor of
  the /etc/modprobe.d/ approach.  If you have anything in your
  /etc/modprobe.conf that you need, and you are using a 2.6.x kernel, be sure
  to copy the configuration to a file (or files) in /etc/modprobe.d/.
  Hint:  ALSA expects sound modules to be configured in /etc/modprobe.d/sound.

  Thanks to Andreas Schnaiter for pointing this out.
n/curl-7.15.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to curl-7.15.3.
  This release fixes a security issue discovered by Ulf Harnhammar.
  libcurl uses the given file part of a TFTP URL in a manner that allows a
  malicious user to overflow a heap-based memory buffer due to the lack of
  boundary check.  This overflow happens if you pass in a URL with a TFTP
  protocol prefix ("tftp://"), using a valid host and a path part that is
  longer than 512 bytes.  The affected flaw can be triggered by a redirect,
  if curl/libcurl is told to follow redirects and an HTTP server points
  the client to a tftp URL with the characteristics described above.
  There is no known exploit at the time of this writing.
  No stable version of Slackware is affected, as the flaw exists only in
  the curl-7.15.x series prior to curl-7.15.3.  
  The cURL advisory may be found here:

  files, so back them up first!  Also, any database files will need to
  be rebuilt due to the move from db-3.3 to db-4.2.
extra/slacktrack/slacktrack-1.28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to slacktrack-1.28_1.

n/sendmail-8.13.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.6.
  This new version of sendmail contains a fix for a security problem
  discovered by Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force.  From sendmail's advisory:
    Sendmail was notified by security researchers at ISS that, under some
    specific timing conditions, this vulnerability may permit a specifically
    crafted attack to take over the sendmail MTA process, allowing remote
    attackers to execute commands and run arbitrary programs on the system
    running the MTA, affecting email delivery, or tampering with other
    programs and data on this system.  Sendmail is not aware of any public
    exploit code for this vulnerability.  This connection-oriented
    vulnerability does not occur in the normal course of sending and
    receiving email.  It is only triggered when specific conditions are
    created through SMTP connection layer commands.

x/x11-6.9.0-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg, which due to being not
  setuid root could not be used by non-root users.  Thanks to the many people
  who reported this issue.  I tracked it down to a new (or rather, back again)
  behavior of "chown", which is removing the suid/sgid bits from any file that
  it touches.  I remember this same situation from the old days, and it's
  why many of the older package builds use a package skeleton and then install
  binaries using "cat" -- this prevents the changing of the permissions.
  If I recall correctly, "strip" also used to do this.  Looking in the kernel
  source, I see some mention in fs/open.c about doing this as a safety feature.
  IMO, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do, though.  If I want chmod,
  I'll use it, thank you.  However, it looks like the feature was added years
  ago, and I have no idea why it has just recently kicked in.  I've gone back
  and tested on a Slackware 10.2 box, and it's also showing the same effects
  with "chown", so it seems to me that this sort of breakage should have
  been happening when the x11*-6.9.0-i486-1.tgz packages were built, too,
  but Xorg was properly setuid in that package set.  I tried dropping back
  to the previous coreutils, and this also didn't help.  It's a mystery.
  Anyway, my first thought was to simply move the "chmod 4711" on Xorg to
  after the last "chown" in the build script, but decided that the best way
  to handle this is to begin phasing out the use of the "bin" group on
  binaries and binary directories.  There was never any use to this ever, so
  far as I can tell.  I think someone working on the FHS just thought that
  root:bin looked nicer, or something.  ;-)  Most distributions install
  binaries as root:root now anyway, and the latest standards no longer
  require root:bin.  Since it doesn't matter, don't expect everything to
  change all at once -- don't send bug reports concerning files or 
  directories that "should be" root:bin or root:root.  We will move away
  from root:bin to root:root as new packages are built.
  I sure hope "strip" doesn't start acting up next...
x/x11-devel-6.9.0-i486-3.tgz:  Rebuilt.  Really, there was no need to rebuild
  this or the below packages, but I like a consistent build number when it's
  not too much trouble to have it.

x/x11-6.9.0-i486-2.tgz:  Patched with x11r6.9.0-geteuid.diff.
  From the x.org security page:
     * March 20, 2006 - A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org
       server as shipped with X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0 (xorg-server 1.0.0 and
       1.0.1) -- this is CVE-2006-0745.  Local users were able to escalate
       privileges to root and cause a DoS if the Xorg server was installed
       setuid root (the default).  Note that earlier releases are not
       vulnerable.
  For more information (eventually), see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0745

  Since this issue does not affect any stable/released version of Slackware,
  there will no security advisory on the mailing list.  Those running -current
  should keep up with the ChangeLog to stay on top of new developments.

a/aaa_base-10.2.0-noarch-3.tgz:  Added /var/empty directory.
a/gawk-3.1.5-i486-2.tgz:  Applied bugfix from the gawk mailing list to fix a
  problem with newer glibc versions pulling that "*** free(): invalid pointer"
  trick we all love.  :-)  Thanks to Grant for sending in a link to the fix.
a/glibc-solibs-2.3.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against 2.4.32 and 2.6.15.6
  kernel headers.  Yes, I have seen that shiny-looking glibc-2.4 release on
  ftp.gnu.org, but glibc-2.4 completely drops support for linuxthreads, and
  therefore will not support vanilla Linux 2.4.x kernels.  I don't think
  we're quite ready for that yet around here.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-3.tgz:  Updated timezone data from tzdata2006c.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.32-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.6.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.32-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.6.
  Thanks to Piter Punk for all the help revising the default entries in 
  /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.new to be more accurate for 2.6.x kernels.  I've tried
  to make it function in the default state under 2.4.x kernels too, though
  some of the modules have different names in 2.4 vs. 2.6...
  Also thanks to Didier Spaier for suggesting an example for DMA usage in the 
  section of rc.modules that loads the parallel-port support.
d/gcc-3.4.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.6.
d/gcc-g++-3.4.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.6.

l/alsa-driver-1.0.11rc3_2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.11rc3
  compiled for Linux 2.4.32.  The 2.6.15.6 kernel does not work properly using
  the modules in alsa-driver-1.0.10, but works fine with these.  Although I'm
  normally against using release candidates, I thought in this case that the
  version of alsa-driver used by the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels should be the same
  since the package does install some header files that would overlap.  It's
  worked fine on both 2.4.32 and 2.6.15.6 here, and the other alsa-* packages
  compile against it without errors (so I don't see a need to update those).
  I think this will work, but let me know if this upgrade causes any problems.
l/db44-4.4.20-i486-1.tgz:  For consistency, change the name of this package from
  db4 to db44, and move the header files into /usr/include/db44/, since that's
  the directory where the next version of Python will be looking for them.
  Oh, and on that topic, I've had a few people send in or provide links to
  patches that fix compiling the latest Python with db-4.4.  Thanks, but it's
  still a more conservative approach to wait until db-4.4 is officially
  supported upstream.  BTW, none of the patches were exactly the same.  :-)
  db-4.3 would also work, but it's probably not worth introducing yet-another
  already old version of db over.
  Added the --enable-cxx option.  (Suggested by Kevin Brammer)
l/glibc-2.3.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against 2.4.32 and 2.6.15.6 kernel
  headers.  Added /var/run/nscd/ directory (thanks to Dirk van Deun).
  Updated timezone data from tzdata2006c.
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.6-noarch-3.tgz:  Rebuilt.
l/glibc-profile-2.3.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against 2.4.32 and 2.6.15.6
  kernel headers.
l/gtk+2-2.8.14-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gtk+2-2.8.14.
n/gnupg-1.4.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnupg-1.4.2.2.
  There have been two security related issues reported recently with GnuPG.
  From the GnuPG 1.4.2.1 and 1.4.2.2 NEWS files:
    Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2.2 (2006-03-08)
    * Files containing several signed messages are not allowed any
      longer as there is no clean way to report the status of such
      files back to the caller.  To partly revert to the old behaviour
      the new option --allow-multisig-verification may be used.
   Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2.1 (2006-02-14)
    * Security fix for a verification weakness in gpgv.  Some input
      could lead to gpgv exiting with 0 even if the detached signature
      file did not carry any signature.  This is not as fatal as it
      might seem because the suggestion as always been not to rely on
      th exit code but to parse the --status-fd messages.  However it
      is likely that gpgv is used in that simplified way and thus we
      do this release.  Same problem with "gpg --verify" but nobody
      should have used this for signature verification without
      checking the status codes anyway.  Thanks to the taviso from
      Gentoo for reporting this problem.

pasture/gnupg-1.2.7-i486-1.tgz:  This can rest here for a little while
  just in case gnupg-1.4.2.2 causes any problems, but I doubt it will.
  I also think gnupg-1.2.7 is still secure when used securely (if that
  makes any sense ;-), or I wouldn't even leave it in /pasture...
testing/packages/linux-2.6.15.6/alsa-driver-1.0.11rc3_2.6.15.6-i486-1.tgz
  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.11rc3 compiled for Linux 2.6.15.6.
  This should fix the "free_hot_cold_page" issue that was occuring with
  alsa-driver-1.0.10 and the 2.6.15+ kernels.  It fixes it here,
  anyway.  :-)

ap/xfsdump-2.2.33-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled to link with libhandle.
d/python-2.4.2-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against Berkeley DB 4.2.52
  to get _bsddb.so and dbm.so to build.  Python finds the db-4.2.52
  headers fine in /usr/include/db42/, so I guess that's the right
  place for them.  :-)
d/python-demo-2.4.2-noarch-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.
d/python-tools-2.4.2-noarch-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.
l/db42-4.2.52-i486-3.tgz:  Added a db-4.2.52 package (called db42)
  as a non-default version of Berkeley DB 4.x, since some things
  still aren't ready for db-4.4.x, and it's probably best not to
  force the issue until the changes needed for db-4.4.x are made
  upstream where needed.  Oh, I've had a report that subversion-1.3.0
  isn't working with db-4.4.x -- can anyone confirm this?  I'm not
  running any kind of test repository here, so feedback on whether
  subversion could use a recompile against db-4.2 would be helpful.

  Split acl, attr, dmapi, and xfsdump into separate packages and
  moved them into the AP series.  This location was a bit of a judgement
  call since acl, attr, and dmapi contain libraries, but so do some other
  packages outside L.  Anyway, it does seem to me that xfsdump should go
  in AP, and that these packages should all be found in the same place.
ap/acl-2.2.34-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to acl-2.2.34, split out of xfsprogs
  package.
ap/attr-2.4.28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to attr-2.4.28, split out of xfsprogs
  package.
ap/dmapi-2.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dmapi-2.2.3, split out of xfsprogs
  package.
ap/xfsdump-2.2.33-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xfsdump-2.2.33, split out of
  xfsprogs package.
d/clisp-2.38-i486-2.tgz:  Added some additional modules for CLISP.
  Thanks to Bradley Reed for the hint.

l/pango-1.10.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pango-1.10.4.
n/bind-9.3.2-i486-3.tgz:  Modified rc.bind to try to use rndc to stop the
  nameserver before resorting to killall, and added some additional comments
  about loading the "capability" module on 2.6+ kernels.
n/samba-3.0.21c-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.21c.
+--------------------------+
Mon Feb 20 14:20:17 CST 2006
ap/dvd+rw-tools-6.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dvd+rw-tools-6.1.
kdei/kde-i18n-sv-3.5.1-noarch-1a.tgz:  Fixed with a rebuild.  Thanks to
  Nille Kungen for pointing out that the -1 package was missing files.
n/bind-9.3.2-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to remove the use of the obsolete setsockopt
  SO_BSDCOMPAT that was putting annoying warnings in /var/log/syslog when bind
  binaries were run under a 2.6.x kernel.  Thanks to Marin Glibic.
  Fixed missing nslookup.1 man page.  Thanks to Lior Kadosh.
n/tin-1.8.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tin-1.8.1.
+--------------------------+
Thu Feb 16 14:01:26 CST 2006
OK, I think I have everything that used libreadline.so.4 recompiled
with the exception of AbiWord, as the --disable-gnome option no
longer seems to work with abiword-2.4.2 -- it still demands
libgnomeprint and all of its dependencies.  Anyone know a way around
this one?  If not, AbiWord will likely be removed soon.  It's
included in all of the GNOME distributions for Slackware anyway...
a/bash-3.1-i486-2.tgz:  Applied official bash patches 006 and 007.
a/coreutils-5.94-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to coreutils-5.94.
a/sed-4.1.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sed-4.1.5.
ap/bc-1.06-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with new libreadline.
ap/gimp-print-4.2.7-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with new libreadline.
ap/rzip-2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to rzip-2.1.

n/ntp-4.2.0a-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ntp-stable-4.2.0a-20060127
  compiled with new libreadline.

extra/parted/parted-1.6.25.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to parted-1.6.25.1,
  compiled with new libreadline.
testing/packages/gnupg-1.4.2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnupg-1.4.2.1.
  This fixes an issue where gpg could exit with zero in certain cases
  where a detached "signature" actually contained no signature.
  However, according to the NEWS file "nobody should have used this
  for signature verification without checking the status codes" with
  --status-fd.  Considering that (and especially this package's placement
  in the /testing directory) I'm not going to issue an advisory here,
  though the NEWS file does admit it is a security weakness.
+--------------------------+
Tue Feb 14 16:08:52 CST 2006
n/php-4.4.2-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed some more bugs from the 4.4.2 release...
  hopefully the third time is the charm.
  Replaced PEAR packages for which the 4.4.2 release contained incorrect
  md5sums:  Archive_Tar-1.3.1, Console_Getopt-1.2, and HTML_Template_IT-1.1.3.
  (this last one was also not upgraded to the stable version that was released
  on 2005-11-01)  Sorry to have delayed the advisories, but these bugs had to
  be fixed first.  IMHO, the security issues are of dubious severity anyway,
  or a more agressive approach would have been taken (though this would likely
  have caused a lot of people to upgrade to the broken -1 or -2 package
  revisions, so anyone who didn't know about this until now was probably saved
  a hassle.)
  Upgraded other PEAR modules to HTTP-1.4.0, Net_SMTP-1.2.8, and XML_RPC-1.4.5.
  Thanks again to Krzysztof Oledzki for the bug report.
testing/packages/php-5.1.2/php-5.1.2-i486-2.tgz:  The same junk
  dotfiles were installed in php-5.1.2, too.  Cleaned them out
  of the root directory of the package.  Thanks to Tyler McGrath
  for reporting this.
+--------------------------+
Fri Feb 10 19:07:13 CST 2006
ap/man-1.6c-i486-2.tgz:  Reversed man-1.6c change that caused
  makewhatis to break.  Thanks to Robby Workman for the patch.
n/php-4.4.2-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt the package to clean up some junk
  dotfiles that were installed in the / directory.  Harmless, but
  sloppy...  Thanks to Krzysztof Oledzki for pointing this out.
+--------------------------+
Thu Feb  9 17:24:25 CST 2006
a/aaa_elflibs-10.2.0-i486-4.tgz:  Added /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 ->
  /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 symlink, needed by Oracle 10g RAC support.
  Thanks to Luigi Genoni.
  Upgraded various other libraries.
a/bash-3.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-3.1.
a/coreutils-5.93-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to coreutils-5.93.
  The DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 is set to provide more
  traditional behavior (thanks to Eric Hameleers), but this may change
  in the future as the newer standards are accepted.  Added
  the uname patch (suggested by many), and moved color ls setup
  out of /etc/profile and /etc/csh.login and into scripts in
  /etc/profile.d/.  These scripts also replace some functionality
  (setting up aliases and defaults) that is no longer part of the
  dircolors tool.
a/cups-1.1.23-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against new OpenSSL.
a/cxxlibs-6.0.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libstdc++ from gcc-3.4.5.
a/etc-5.1-noarch-11.tgz:  Removed color ls setup from /etc/profile
  and /etc/csh.login.  Fixed csh.login in cases where $TERM or $MANPATH
  are not set.  (thanks to Jim Diamond)
a/gettext-0.14.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gettext-0.14.5.
a/glibc-solibs-2.3.6-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.5
  against the 2.4.32 and 2.6.15.3 kernel headers.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
a/gpm-1.20.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gpm-1.20.1, with many, many patches.
a/openssl-solibs-0.9.8a-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.8a.
  This may require many things to be recompiled.  Let me know if I
  skipped anything that matters.  :-)
a/pkgtools-10.2.0-i486-6.tgz:  Upgraded subset of terminfo database from
  ncurses-5.5.  Upgraded to dialog-1.0-20060126.
a/procps-3.2.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to procps-3.2.6.
a/tcsh-6.14.00-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to remove built-in color ls, as the new
  coreutils adds an 'su' feature to the shared $LS_COLORS variable that
  causes tcsh to exit.  Perhaps tcsh should use a different variable name or
  be less strict about using LS_COLORS?  The GNU ls version is probably
  better for most purposes anyway, though.
ap/espgs-8.15.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to espgs-8.15.1.
ap/linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21-i486-1.tgz:  Added linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21.
  This package replaces the sgml-tools package and should contain the
  essentials needed to handle modern Linux Docbook/SGML documents.  Huge
  thanks are due to Stuart Winter for doing most of the work on transitioning
  Slackware from the old sgml-tools system to this one!  :-)
ap/man-1.6c-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to man-1.6c.
ap/man-pages-2.22-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to man-pages-2.22.
ap/mdadm-2.3.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mdadm-2.3.1.
ap/mysql-5.0.18-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mysql-5.0.18.
  (this will require everything linked to MySQL libs to be recompiled)
ap/sgml-tools-1.0.9-i486-12.tgz:  Removed.  (replaced with linuxdoc-tools)
ap/sudo-1.6.8p12-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sudo-1.6.8p12.
  This fixes an issue where a user able to run a Python script through sudo
  may be able to gain root access.
  IMHO, running any kind of scripting language from sudo is still not safe...

d/bison-2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bison-2.1.
  I think enough of the upstream sources are expecting bison-2.x now, but let
  me know if you find breakage (for which patches or pointers to upgrades
  would be welcome.)
d/clisp-2.38-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to clisp-2.38.

d/make-3.80-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed an out-of-memory bug in make, since
  nobody upstream seems concerned about putting out a fixed make
  release any time soon.  Is "make" dead?  ;-)
  Reported here by:  Mihnea-Costin Grigore, penguinista, and ePAc.
d/nasm-0.98.39-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to nasm-0.98.39.

  The bsddb module didn't build against the new 4.4.x version of
  Berkeley DB.  Does anyone care?  Or perhaps have a patch?  :-)

l/db4-4.4.20-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Berkeley DB 4.4.20.  This will
  require rebuilding any databases that use the older spec as things
  are recompiled to use this, and I'm planning to do that whereever
  possible.  Just be glad I don't do this with every new BDB release
  like I used to.  :-)

a/kernel-ide-2.4.32-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.5.
  Apparently the nVidia driver demands that the kernel be compiled with the
  same compiler that will be used to compile the kernel module wrapper for the
  binary nVidia driver (though my guess is that if this restriction were not
  coded into their installer that it would work fine), so I've recompiled all
  the 2.4.32 kernels and modules using the new compiler.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.32-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.5.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.10_2.4.32-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.4.5.
x/x11-docs-html-6.9.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to X11R6.9.0.
  For those who may not be aware, this is is the exact same code base as
  X11R7.0.0, but is packaged as the traditional single source archive using
  the imake build system.  Also, note that this still rightly (IMHO) contains
  freetype-2.1.9.  The newer release of freetype (2.1.10) removed some functions
  that various applications use -- I'm hoping that these will be restored.
  Finally, the kernel interface for direct rendering (DRI) seems to have changed,
  and direct rendering with X11R6.9.0 only works on my machines with a 2.6
  kernel.  I spent several days trying to produce working DRM kernel modules
  for Linux 2.4.32, but to no avail, so if you're still using a 2.4 kernel
  you'll want to edit your xorg.conf so that the dri module is not loaded
  or you'll likely corrupt your display requiring a reboot.  I've tested this
  only with ATI cards and the open source drivers.  Perhaps the binary drivers
  from ATI or nVidia would work.

  not "l/alsa-driver-1.0.10_2.4.32-i486-1.tgz".  I'd been looking at the
  alsa-driver package to see if it had the same issue (it doesn't), and
  then listed the wrong package in the ChangeLog.  Sorry about that.
  Oh, and there was really nothing wrong with the modules in the
  kernel-modules-2.4.32-i486-1 package that a 'depmod -a' wouldn't fix.
  That's the only change that went into the package -- the modules are
  the same.  Thanks to Victor Keranov for pointing out my mistake.

Sat Dec 10 23:28:42 CST 2005

It's a girl!  :-)

I know a lot of you have been wondering what's going on here, and the news
is that my wife Andrea delivered our first child, a daughter Briah Cecilia
(briah at slackware dot com :-) on 2005-11-22, and that event (and the weeks
that led up to it) has had to take priority over the usual tasks of
download/compile/test/package/upload.  But, things should be getting back to
normal here (more or less) over the next couple of weeks, particularly after
the holiday season has come and gone.  As you might expect, there are a lot of
friends and relatives who want to see her.  :-)

Thanks for your patience, and we now return you to your regularly scheduled
ChangeLog...

a/bash-3.0-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed an obscure bug where suspending the first process
  started in a new shell would cause it to hang.
  Thanks to Grant Coady for discovering and fixing this bug.
a/bzip2-1.0.3-i486-2.tgz:  Patched a minor bug in the libbz2 shared library
  Makefile to enable support for large files.  Thanks to Timothy C. McGrath
  and Manuel Jose Blanca Molinos both of whom pointed out this problem and
  provided fixes.
a/glibc-solibs-2.3.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.6 shared libraries.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.3.6-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.6 timezone info.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.32 bare.i kernel.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.32 kernel modules.
ap/alsa-utils-1.0.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-utils-1.0.10.
  In /etc/rc.d/rc.alsa, load snd-seq-oss.  (Thanks to Tomas Matejicek)
d/gcc-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.  gcc-4.x isn't ready yet as
  a prime time compiler yet, IMHO -- still too many things it can't compile,
  internal compiler errors, and the like.  How much of that is the compiler
  and how much is source needing to be updated is a matter for debate,
  though.  Also, the -mcpu=i686 option used in Slackware to optimize
  binaries for i686 or Athlon platforms has changed to -mtune=i686 with the
  gcc-3.4.x compiler series.  I'll be updating the SlackBuilds over time as
  the packages are upgraded.
d/gcc-g++-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.
d/gcc-g77-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.
d/gcc-gnat-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.
d/gcc-java-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.
d/gcc-objc-3.4.4-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-3.4.4.
d/kernel-headers-2.4.32-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.32 kernel headers.
k/kernel-source-2.4.32-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.32 kernel source.
l/alsa-driver-1.0.10_2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.10 for
  Linux 2.4.32.
l/alsa-lib-1.0.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-lib-1.0.10.
l/alsa-oss-1.0.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to alsa-oss-1.0.10.
l/glibc-2.3.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.6.
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.6-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.6 i18n files.
  Added files in /usr/share/locale that hadn't previously been included in
  this package (thanks to Lasse Collin).
l/glibc-profile-2.3.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.6.
n/dnsmasq-2.24-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dnsmasq-2.24.  Thanks to Simon Kelley
  (and one of his anonymous testers) for helping to update the SlackBuild.
n/php-4.4.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with a patch from PHP CVS that fixes issues
  with SquirrelMail and possibly other PHP applications.  I'd hoped there would
  be a new PHP out quickly to address this but since there isn't I'm making an
  exception to the usual policy here on merging patches from CVS as a fair
  number of users seem to be affected by this issue.  Let me know if this
  doesn't help or if any undesired side effects are noticed.
  This problem was first reported here by Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi, but was
  later reported by too many people to list.  Thanks, everyone!  :-)
xap/mozilla-firefox-1.5-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to firefox-1.5.
bootdisks/*:  Upgraded to Linux 2.4.32.
extra/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.1pre25_2.4.32-i486-1.tgz:

  Upgraded to alsa-driver-1.0.10 for Linux 2.6.14.3.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.14.3/kernel-generic-2.6.14.3-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.14.3 (generic kernel).
testing/packages/linux-2.6.14.3/kernel-headers-2.6.14.3-i386-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to kernel headers from Linux 2.6.14.3 (see the README
  file in testing/packages/linux-2.6.14.3/ for information about
  why you probably *don't* want to use these headers...)
testing/packages/linux-2.6.14.3/kernel-modules-2.6.14.3-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to kernel modules for Linux 2.6.14.3.
testing/packages/linux-2.6.14.3/kernel-source-2.6.14.3-noarch-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.14.3 kernel source.
testing/packages/php-5.1.1/php-5.1.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.1.1.
  This no longer seems to ship with PEAR, and if anyone knows why this is or
  how to go about adding it back to the package (if it's still required), I'd
  be interested to know.
testing/packages/thunderbird-1.5rc1/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5rc1-i686-1.tgz:
  Added thunderbird-1.5rc1.
+--------------------------+
Mon Nov  7 19:54:57 CST 2005
n/elm-2.5.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to elm2.5.8.
  This fixes a buffer overflow in the parsing of the Expires header that
  could be used to execute arbitrary code as the user running Elm.
  Thanks to Ulf Harnhammar for finding the bug and reminding me to get
  out updated packages to address the issue.

Sat Nov  5 21:55:21 CST 2005
l/libxml2-2.6.22-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libxml2-2.6.22.
  This fixes an issue where libxml2 had declared a variable XML_FEATURE_UNICODE
  that was already used by the expat headers, causing PHP to fail to compile
  when using Slackware's combination of ./configure options.
n/curl-7.12.2-i486-2.tgz:  Patched.  This addresses a buffer overflow in
  libcurl's NTLM function that could have possible security implications.
  For more details, see:
    http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3185
  (* Security fix *)
n/samba-3.0.20b-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.20b.
  This includes various bugfixes.  Thanks to Christopher Linnet for reporting
  that this fixes a problem with printing to a printer on an XP machine from
  CUPS.  If you use such a configuration, you'll want this upgrade for sure.
n/mod_ssl-2.8.25_1.3.34-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.25-1.3.34.
n/wget-1.10.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to wget-1.10.2.
  This addresses a buffer overflow in wget's NTLM handling function that could
  have possible security implications.
  For more details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3185
  (* Security fix *)
n/php-4.4.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-4.4.1.
  Fixes a number of bugs, including several minor security fixes relating to
  the overwriting of the GLOBALS array.
  (* Security fix *)
n/lynx-2.8.5rel.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lynx-2.8.5rel.5.
  Fixes an issue where the handling of Asian characters when using lynx to
  connect to an NNTP server (is this a common use?) could result in a buffer
  overflow causing the execution of arbitrary code. 
  For more details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3120
  (* Security fix *)
n/apache-1.3.34-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.34.
  Fixes this minor security bug:  "If a request contains both Transfer-Encoding
  and Content-Length headers, remove the Content-Length, mitigating some HTTP
  Request Splitting/Spoofing attacks."
  (* Security fix *)
n/pine-4.64-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pine-4.64.
n/tcpdump-3.9.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tcpdump-3.9.4.
n/imapd-4.64-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to imapd-4.64.
  A buffer overflow was reported in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function.
  However, this function in the c-client library does not appear to be called
  from anywhere in imapd.  iDefense states that the issue is of LOW risk to
  sites that allow users shell access, and LOW-MODERATE risk to other servers.
  I believe it's possible that it is of NIL risk if the function is indeed
  dead code to imapd, but draw your own conclusions...
  (* Security fix *)
kde/koffice-1.4.1-i486-2.tgz:  Patched.
  Fixes a buffer overflow in KWord's RTF import discovered by Chris Evans.
  For more details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2971
  (* Security fix *)

  There, now hopefully we can start getting some REAL work done around here
  again soon...
+--------------------------+
Thu Oct 13 13:57:25 PDT 2005
a/openssl-solibs-0.9.7g-i486-2.tgz:  Patched.
  Fixed a vulnerability that could, in rare circumstances, allow an attacker
  acting as a "man in the middle" to force a client and a server to negotiate
  the SSL 2.0 protocol (which is known to be weak) even if these parties both
  support SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0.

xap/xine-lib-1.0.3a-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xine-lib-1.0.3a.
  This fixes a format string bug where an attacker, if able to upload malicious
  information to a CDDB server and then get a local user to play a certain
  audio CD, may be able to run arbitrary code on the machine as the user
  running the xine-lib linked application.

xap/mozilla-thunderbird-1.0.7-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to thunderbird-1.0.7.
  This fixes a security issue where URLs passed on the command line to the
  thunderbird shell script were not correctly protected against
  interpretation by the shell.  As a result, a malicious URL could contain
  embedded shell commands which would then be executed as the user running
  Thunderbird.

x/x11-6.8.2-i486-4.tgz:  Rebuilt with a modified patch for an earlier pixmap
  overflow issue.  The patch released by X.Org was slightly different than
  the one that was circulated previously, and is an improved version.  There
  have been reports that the earlier patch broke WINE and possibly some
  other programs.
