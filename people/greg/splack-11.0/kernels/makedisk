Welcome to the 09Slackware07 Linux $VERSION $DISKNAME bootdisk!

If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after one of the valid configuration names:  ramdisk (to load a rootdisk
into memory and boot it), and mount (to boot an existing Linux partition).
NOTE:  Most hardware is auto-detected without parameters.  So, before assuming
       your system requires parameters, try a few different bootdisks. :^)

Here are some examples (and more can be found in the BOOTING file):
   ramdisk hdx=cyls,heads,sects,wpcom,irq  (needed only if probing fails)
   ramdisk hdx=cdrom (force detection of an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive)
   where hdx can be any of hda through hdh. Examples: hdc=1050,32,64  hdd=cdrom

If you would rather load the root/install disk from your second floppy drive:
   ramdisk root=/dev/fd1

In a pinch, you can boot your Linux system with a command like:
   mount root=/dev/hda1

DON'T SWITCH ANY DISKS YET! This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.
If you don't need to enter any parameters, hit ENTER to continue.

cat << EOF > $MOUNT/f1.txt
 STANDARD MODES:
 To make the kernel prompt for standard video modes use: vga=ask

 FRAMEBUFFER MODES:
 To get the kernel to start in VESA framebuffer mode, you need to pass it
 a vga= init string on the "boot:" prompt.  Here's a table:

   Colors   640x480 800x600 1024x768 1280x1024 1600x1200
  --------+---------------------------------------------
  256     |   769     771      773      775       796
  32,768  |   784     787      790      793       797
  65,536  |   785     788      791      794       798
  16.8M   |   786     789      792      795       799

  ...such as this for 1024x768x64k:
   vga=791

  F2 returns to the previous page.
