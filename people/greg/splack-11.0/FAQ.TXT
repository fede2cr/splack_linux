
These are questions people ask me quite often.  Hopefully now that 
they're answered here that won't be the case.

Many of these questions are old and obsolete, but I leave them in here 
because they might give somebody ideas about how to approach similar 
problems.  Also, you'll notice that several of these aren't even phrased 
as questions, but are more like screaming complaints.  Hey, I wanted to be 
accurate. :^)

    drive?
Q3: Now that the N series doesn't fit on floppy disks, how do I get

-----

Q1: After installation, my ethernet, CD-ROM drive, and/or other hardware
    that I thought Linux supported doesn't work.  Why?

A: Probably because the kernel you're running doesn't contain the 
   support.  To fix the problem, you'll have to install a kernel that 
   does.  There might a suitable kernel in the /kernels directory on the 
   CD-ROM, or you can compile a custom kernel for your machine.  This 
   isn't too difficult -- see the instructions below about compiling a 
   new kernel.  

   You can also try loading the device driver in the form of a kernel 
   module.  There are drivers for nearly all the hardware supported by 
   Linux in the /modules directory on the CD-ROM, or in your /lib/modules 
   directory if you've installed the modules.tgz package.  Take a look at 
   your /etc/rc.d/rc.modules file for examples of how to load these.

-----

Q2: Is it possible to install this operating system without a floppy 
    drive?

A: Yes!  And it's not much harder, either.

(NOTE:  see rootdisks/install.zip for a new approach to this)

First, you'll need a DOS partition.  Install Loadlin in a directory such
as C:\LOADLIN (the Loadlin package is available as a ZIP file in the 
kernels/ directory).  Once you have Loadlin installed, you'll need to 
copy a Linux kernel and a Slackware installer image into the C:\LOADLIN 
directory.  We'll describe this process next:

You can find many kernels in the kernels/ directory on the CD.  The 
subdirectories have the same names as the Slackware bootdisks, and 
contain the kernel used to make that bootdisk.  You might want to refer to 
the README files in the bootdisks directory to decide which kernel will 
work best for your system.  Once you've picked a kernel (zImage or 
bzImage), copy it into the C:\LOADLIN directory.  Next, grab the installer 
image (named 'initrd.img') from the isolinux directory and copy the file 
into your Loadlin directory.

Now, to start the installation process you'll need to boot DOS.  If you 
run Windows95, restarting the computer in MS-DOS mode is an option on the 
Start button menu.  (NOTE:  If you miss the good-old-days when you got DOS 
automatically when you booted your computer and had to type "win" to 
actually start Windows, it's easy to fix Windows95 to work that way again.  
Edit the file C:\MSDOS.SYS and change where it says BootGUI=1 to read 
BootGUI=0)

Once you have DOS started, change into the Loadlin directory and use a 
command like this one to start the installation rootdisk:

loadlin zimage rw root=/dev/ram initrd=initrd.img load_ramdisk=1

Usually the installation copies the kernel from the bootdisk, so when you 
use this method you'll have to skip that menu, as well as the bootdisk 
creation menu.  It's also advisable to skip the LILO menu, since the 
/vmlinuz will probably not be the one you want.  You best bet is to use 
Loadlin, since it's gotten you this far.  Just edit the LINUX.BAT file to 
point to your root Linux partition.

-----

Q3: Now that the N series doesn't fit on floppy disks, how do I get 
    network support into my laptop?

A:  Start by installing the A series.  Then, put the tcpip.tgz package 
    from the N series on a floppy disk.  If your kernel doesn't contain 
    network support, put the netmods.tgz (network kernel modules) package 
    on another disk.  If you need PPP, put the PPP package on there, too.  
    Then, (after rebooting, not from the setup floppies) run "pkgtool".  
    Choose the "Install packages from floppy disks" choice, and install 
    the tcpip1.tgz netmods.tgz, and ppp.tgz packages.  Then run netconfig 
    to set up your network, pppsetup to configure ppp, and edit 
    /etc/rc.d/rc.modules to load support for your ethernet card.  When 
    you reboot, the machine should be network-capable, and you can proceed 
    to add more software from there.

-----

Q4: Why isn't my Sony CDU-31/33a detected by Linux anymore?  It used to work!

A: From the source code:

 + * WARNING -   All autoprobes have been removed from the driver.
 + *             You MUST configure the CDU31A via a LILO config
 + *             at boot time or in lilo.conf.  I have the
 + *             following in my lilo.conf:
 + *
 + *                append="cdu31a=0x1f88,0,PAS"
 + *
 + *             The first number is the I/O base address of the
 + *             card.  The second is the interrupt (0 means none).
 + *             The third should be "PAS" if on a Pro-Audio
 + *             spectrum, or nothing if on something else.

You can also use this option with Loadlin:

C:\LOADLIN\LOADLIN C:\LINUX\VMLINUZ root=/dev/hda1 cdu31a=0x1f88,0,PAS

Or, on the bootdisk LILO: prompt.  Examples:

LILO: ramdisk cdu31a=0x1f88,0,PAS

LILO: mount root=/dev/sda1 cdu31a=0x1f88,0,PAS ro

-----

Q5: I can't get the kernel to see a CD-ROM connected to a Soundblaster 16 IDE!

A: First, be sure you're using the proper kernel -- the one needed in this
   case is the IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM type, not the SBPCD type.  Then, if you still
   have problems, use the secondary IDE channel (IRQ 15 0x170), and make sure
   the drive is set as master (jumper in the back) and not as slave (a common
   default).

-----

Q6: I can't get the disks made by RAWRITE to boot!

A: First, check that you're using the right size image.  If you use an image
   meant for a 1.44 MB floppy on a 1.2 MB floppy (or vice-versa) you'll likely
   see the message "LI" and the boot process will hang.

   Another possibility is a BIOS problem -- a user has reported to me that
   RAWRITE fails on his machine unless he first does "dir a:" on an MS-DOS
   floppy.  Apparently this is caused by the BIOS improperly initializing
   address 0000:0526 (number of sectors) to 11h instead of 12h.  Using "dir"
   on the device fixes that value.  The affected machine in this case was using
   "Mr. BIOS" from Unicore Software. 

-----

Q7: I was able to install fine, but the installed system won't boot!

A: Slackware uses stripped down kernels to do the actual installation -- in
   other words, the kernels don't have any more drivers than needed to control
   only the device needed to complete the installation.  If you don't install
   the bootdisk kernel, it's possible to install with (for example) the bare.i
   IDE bootdisk, but install the SCSI kernel from the A series onto your
   hard drive.  Since this kernel is has many SCSI drivers built-in, this can
   lead to hangs at boot time if the kernel misidentifies a piece of hardware
   that's unusual or at a non-standard port/IRQ.

   When this happens, you need to try a different kernel.  First, use the
   bootdisk that worked during installation to get your system started.  To
   do this, boot the disk and enter something like this at the LILO prompt:

   mount root=/dev/sda2

   (if /dev/sda2 is your root Linux partition, otherwise use the appropriate
   device name for your system)

   Once you've got the system running, install or compile a different kernel.
   Try to include only the device drivers you need for your hardware.  

   Instructions on compiling the kernel can be found in your kernel source
   directory (if you installed the kernel source, that is).  The kernel
   source is usually found in /usr/src/linux.

   Briefly, this is the method for building a new kernel:

   cd /usr/src/linux
   make config   (then answer the questions about what you need)
   make dep ; make clean ; make zImage

   If the zImage is successfully built, see an answer below which explains
   how to install it with LILO or Loadlin, or make a new bootdisk from it.
   Once you've done that, you might want to clean up /usr/src/linux by cd'ing
   into it and doing another 'make clean'.

   Good luck!  If you can handle this, you're well on your way to becoming a
   Linux guru.

-----

Q8: Why do I get "network unreachable" under Slackware?

A: There are a couple of possibilities. For most users, things work right out
   of the box. However, if you're running into this problem here are two
   workarounds you can try:

   1. Reverse the broadcast and netmask arguments (and their variables)
      in the call to ifconfig in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1. Make sure you are
      not trying to route your own IP address - you shouldn't have to.

   2. Make sure /etc/networks is properly configured.

   3. You may want to try the 'netconfig' script.
      It's not perfect, but does a pretty good job. 

   4. Make sure the kernel you're using supports your hardware.  Most of the
      kernels provided with Slackware include a /boot/config file where you
      can look up the compilation options.

-----

Q9: Why the $%#@! isn't my UltraStor SCSI detected? It works under DOS!

A: Set the I/O address to 0x340 instead to 0x330.
 
   For any hardware that doesn't work, a good rule is to try playing around
   with the IRQ and I/O settings on it to see what happens. If your system
   is up and running and you're having problems with a CD-ROM or tape or
   something like this, you can always look around for the driver source in
   /usr/src/linux/drivers... really, it won't bite!  Often, the source 
   contains important documentation, such as the default IRQ settings for
   that type of device, and the major number for the entry in /dev. Also,
   try other bootdisks and see if that helps.

-----

Q10: If the setup menus for NFS installation don't work, how can I setup the
     network manually before starting setup?

A: Once your Linux machine is listed in the hosts /etc/exports (if the whole
   network is not already), you might need to do these things before running
   setup.  This is usually only needed if the NFS server is on a different
   subnet than your Linux machine:

 # Setup the loopback device:
 ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
 route add -net 127.0.0.0

 # Setup the network:
 ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4        # 1.2.3.4 is the ip number of my machine.
 route add -net 1.2.3.0
 route add default gw 1.2.3.1 # in this example, the ip address of our NFS 
                             # server is 1.2.31.4 and belongs to a different
                             # network.

Q11: My IBM Thinkpad won't load the rootdisk into a ramdisk correctly, so I 
     can't install Linux.  What can I do?

A: The disk-changed sensor on some older Thinkpads works a little differently.
   This can be worked around -- just specify "floppy=thinkpad" when booting:

   boot:  ramdisk floppy=thinkpad

   ... on the bootdisk's LILO prompt.
 
-----

Q12: My large (> 1/2 gig) IDE drive reports more than 16 heads, and as a 
     result Linux won't install on it. What can I do?

A: See the file /docs/mini/Large-IDE for instructions on how to make it work.
   (Thanks to Bob DiMarco for forwarding this to me, and Patrick LoPresti for
   compiling the information in the first place)

   Note that newer kernels (> 1.1.40) will do this translation for you 
   automatically, and thus make the workaround unnecessary.

-----

Q13: How do I make a Slackware bootdisk with this new kernel I made?

A: OK, well you grab an existing one (preferably one of the larger ones
   like "scsinet.s"), put it on a floppy, and do this:

   mount /dev/fd0 /mnt (this mounts it)
   cat zImage > /mnt/vmlinuz (put the new kernel in place)
   rdev -R /mnt/vmlinuz 0    (mount read-write)
   rdev /mnt/vmlinuz /dev/fd0u1440   (use that drive, or /dev/fd0h1200)
   rdev -r /mnt/vmlinuz 49152  (enable the ramdisk)
   lilo -r /mnt  (reinstall lilo)
   umount /mnt   (that's it! you're done! :^)

-----

Q14: My backspace is acting strangely under X?  How can I fix it?

A: Well, I've never noticed a real problem, but I occasionally hear 
   about this.  You might want to try adding this to your .Xmodmap in
   /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit or $HOME:

keycode 22 = BackSpace

-----

Q15: I just built a new kernel. Now how to I go about replacing my existing
     kernel with this new bzImage file?

A: First, you must prepare the new kernel. If you're using UMSDOS, you'll want 
   your system to boot read-write. Otherwise, you'll want it to boot read-only
   so your filesystems can be safely checked. So, do this:

   For UMSDOS:
      rdev -R bzImage 0
   For any other filesystem type:
      rdev -R bzImage 1

   Then, you'll need to set the root partition. For example, if your root 
   Linux partition is /dev/hda2, you'd do this:
 
      rdev bzImage /dev/hda2

   Then, you can set a video mode if you like. As an example, this sets normal
   80x25 console mode:

      rdev -v bzImage -1

   Other modes include:  -3 = Prompt, -2 = Extended VGA. You might need to 
   remove a line in your /etc/lilo.conf that forces normal video if you use
   LILO and wish to try an extended video mode.

   Next, you need to install the kernel. If you boot from a floppy disk, you
   can simply stick a formatted floppy into your drive and write the bzImage
   to it like this:

   cat bzImage > /dev/fd0

   If you use lilo, you should copy the bzImage to where your lilo.conf expects
   it to be (probably /vmlinuz) and then reinstall lilo.  This should work if
   you used Slackware's liloconfig script to set up LILO. (this is the script 
   setup uses)

   cp bzImage /vmlinuz ; lilo
  
   You may wish to back up your existing /vmlinuz first.

   If you use Loadlin, copy the kernel to your DOS partition where Loadlin can
   see it (if you use UMSDOS, you won't need to do this).  Then, start Linux
   from DOS like this:  

     c:\loadlin\loadlin.exe c:\linux\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda2

   That should do it.
   
-----

Q16: Why can't I cut and paste from elvis (vi) in an xterm?

A: Later versions of elvis use the mouse for cursor positioning instead. If
   you want to cut and paste, hold the left shift key down while you use the
   mouse.

-----

Q17: Why doesn't my bus mouse work? The kernel, selection, the
     X server and test-mouse all say "no such device."

A: The kernels distributed with Slackware don't have the drivers for
   busmice compiled in. Last time I tried to include all of them there
   were horrible driver conflicts -- better to leave them out if they
   can't coexist.  Obviously, it's not feasible for me to provide 
   versions of every precompiled kernel for each type of busmouse. I 
   only have a 386. ;^)

   (I'm only kidding,  As of 3/1999, I'm running a P2-450)

   The solution is to load support for your mouse from a kernel module.
   Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.modules and uncomment the line for your mouse:

   # Mouse support:
   #/sbin/modprobe atixlmouse
   #/sbin/modprobe busmouse
   #/sbin/modprobe msbusmouse

   (To uncomment a line in a shell script, you use an editor to remove the
   '#' from the start of the line)

-----

Q18: I see my SoundBlaster/Panasonic CD-ROM detected at boot, but I can't
     install from it or mount it. What's going on?

A. Try setting to drive's ID to 0. This is expected by the install disks.
   There should be a jumper on the back of the drive that selects this --
   just move it to the leftmost position.

-----

Q19: I'm using UMSDOS and would like to use the same swapspace under Windows
     and Linux. Can this be done?

A: If you want to share a Linux-UMSDOS swapfile with MS-Windows, you can
   do the following:

   1. Create PERMANENT(!) swap file in MS-Windows with size NNNN kbytes.
   2. In /etc/rc.d/rc.local add the following lines:

   rm -f /DOS/windows/spart.par  <--- Needed in order to suppress
                                      Windows complain on next start!
   mkswap /DOS/386spart.par NNNN
   sync
   swapon /DOS/386spart.par

   3.In /etc/rc.d/rc.0 add "swapoff" for this file.

-----

Q20: What's the password for root on the install disk?

A: There isn't one. If you're asked for one, it usually means that you
   don't have enough memory to install.

   To help work around this, look in your CMOS settings and make sure you don't
   have any ROM shadowing enabled. ROM shadowing wastes memory and won't
   improve the performance of Linux. Also, make sure you're using the smallest
   bootdisk you can. For example, you don't need to use "scsinet" if
   you're not installing to a SCSI drive via NFS. Use something small -- the
   "bare" disk if you can get away with it. Some people mistakenly think they
   need to use a bootdisk with network drivers if they plan to use
   networking after installation. Not so! The drivers on the bootdisk
   have no impact on what you can use *after* installation -- in almost all
   cases you won't be running the same kernel on your installed system as
   you used to install it.

-----

Q21: How can I install and remove software now that the Slackware Linux 
     distribution is installed on my machine?

A: To remove packages, type "pkgtool" and follow the prompts. Pkgtool will
   also allow you to add packages that are in the current directory.

   The preferred way to install software is with the "setup" script.
   When you do your initial installation, setup puts a copy of itself in your 
   /sbin for future use. You can also add software to your machine using the 
   boot/install disk, if you really want to. 

   When adding software to a running system via NFS, it is preferable to
   mount the partition yourself and then use the 'install from a mounted
   directory' feature of setup.

   There are also command line utilities that allow you to create, install,
   and remove packages. For these, you should refer to the manpages:
   installpkg(8), removepkg(8), makepkg(8), explodepkg(8). A simple example
   of how you would install a package with installpkg:

   installpkg package.tgz

-----

Q22:  How do I know what files setup/pkgtool/installpkg is putting where?

A.  Look around in /var/adm/packages.
    Similarly, you can find installation scripts for each package in 
    /var/adm/scripts.

-----

Q23: I set my partitions to "Linux native" but Slackware still won't detect
     them! What can I do?

A: This problem is rare and I still don't know what causes it.

   [ Note that this is not the same problem that usually affects the IBM PS/1,
   Thinkpad, and similar machines that do not detect the harddrive. If you've
   got one of these machines, and fdisk is giving you problems, your answer is
   still ahead :^) ]

   Here's a workaround you can use to install anyway:

   1. Start text.gz using one of the bootdisks.
   2. Make and format partitions for Linux.
   3. Mount the target partitions under /mnt.
   4. Type "setup -target_mounted"
   5. Follow the rest of the instructions to install.
   6. Type "vi /mnt/etc/fstab" and enter an appropriate fstab.
      As an example, here's what mine contains:

/dev/hdb2   swap    swap   defaults 
/dev/hda2   /       ext2   defaults
/dev/hda3   /usr    xiafs  defaults 
/dev/hda1   /dos    msdos  defaults 
/dev/hdb1   /os2    msdos  defaults 
none        /proc   proc   defaults

   To give you some more info about this file, the first field is the
   partition to be mounted, the second is where it should be mounted, the
   third is the filesystem type, and the last field is the options to use.
   Unless you're a Linux wizard, just set this to "defaults".

   Other things to remember about this file:
      - Make sure that you list the root partition before any other partitions
        that are mounted beneath it.
      - Add the /proc line, or "ps", "w", etc, won't work.
      - It's a good idea to put a blank line at the end of the file, as I've
        had reports that partitions listed on the last line might not be 
        mounted.

   7. Once you've made and saved this file you can reboot with ctrl-alt-delete.

-----

Q24: I have a (PS/1 || Valuepoint || Thinkpad), and can't install because fdisk
     can't see my hard drive. How can I get around this?

A: You'll need to enter your drive parameters at the bootdisk prompt. You
   can even specify the geometry for your second IDE drive by supplying a
   second  hd= parameter right after the first one. 

   When you boot the bootdisk, you'll see more information about the
   format used to pass your drive parameters to the kernel at the LILO prompt
   and allow your drive to be recognized.

   You'll have to edit your lilo.conf file to add a similar hd= flag if you
   want LILO to work. Add this as the TOP line in the file:

   append="hd=cyl,hds,secs"

   Where "cyl", "hds", and "secs" are the number of cylinders, sectors,
   and heads on the drive.

   If you have two IDE drives, specify both drives (like this):

   append="hd=967,13,31 hd=944,14,40"

Q25: Why do my /etc/issue and /etc/motd keep resetting themselves at boot time?

A: The /etc/rc.d/rc.S resets them out every time you boot after figuring out
   which kernel you're running -- otherwise the kernel version printed at login
   might not stay current.

   If you want to write your own /etc/issue and /etc/motd, you need to comment
   out that part of /etc/rc.d/rc.S.

Q26: Emacs dumps core, complains of a missing library, or lacks X11 support!

A: The GNU Emacs series includes your choice of a version with X11 support, or
   one without. Make sure you have the right binary for your machine. 

   The binary supporting X11 is installed as part of a package on the first 
   disk that you'll need to install whether you want X11 support or not. If
   you DO NOT want X11 support, install the package 'emac_nox.tgz' on the last
   disk of the Emacs series.

   If you just install all of the disks, you don't get X11 support. It had to
   be one way or the other, so if you're not paying attention when you install
   at least this way it will run no matter what.

Q27: Why do my compiles sometimes die with 'signal 11: internal compiler error'?

A: This indicates a hardware problem in about 99% of the cases. It can usually
   be fixed by increasing the number of wait states in the CMOS settings. It
   can almost always be fixed by turning off the RAM cache, but this should be
   your last resort since it will cause a noticeable slowdown.

   Another common reason for this problem is heat, particularly in the case
   of an overclocked CPU.  I've had some machines suffer from this over
   the years, especially under heavy load.  If the signal 11 problem seems
   more common when the machine's been running for a while, it could well be
   heat-related.  Try running the machine with the case open.  If that doesn't
   seem to help, aim a fan at the motherboard.  (I've had to run machines
   containing hot-running SCSI drives this way for their entire lives)  A
   quality CPU fan helps a lot, too.  If you have an underpowered fan/heatsink,
   consider a replacement from TennMax (www.TennMax.com).  I've had excellent
   results with their fans.  (a dual-fan model stabilized my P2-450)

   latest version of the Signal 11 FAQ at http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/

Q28: How can I change (or get rid of) the color ls?

A: Read the man page, and check out the file /etc/DIR_COLORS. You can
   configure the colors any way you like, or shut them off entirely. Also, you
   can copy /etc/DIR_COLORS into your home directory as '.dir_colors' to 
   override the global defaults on a user by user basis.

Q29: I start X with "startx" and it works OK, but I can't switch virtual
     consoles. Why?

A: On a Linux text screen, you switch virtual consoles with Alt-F1 through 
   Alt-F8. Under X, you must use Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F8. 
   Another useful 'secret' key combination is RightShift-PgUp/PgDown for
   scrollback. (a random amount ranging from none to a few pages, depending
   on the state of your video text buffer memory)

Q30: Why can't I use the new ghostscript with X?

A: Make sure you have gs_x11.tgz from disk XAP1 installed.

-----

Q31: I can't get anything to work at all! What's the deal?

A: If you seem to suffer catastrophic failure (!), then check the file FILE_LIST
   on ftp.slackware.com in /pub/slackware against the contents of your disks
   and make sure you're not missing any files. 

   Also, I've noticed that most of the reports of kernel panics and system 
   hangs have come from people with 4MB. If you're running into these types
   of problems I'd suggest forking over the $$$ for 4 more meg. I have 8 MB of
   RAM and never have crashes. (well, only when I really push my luck)
   If you don't want to do that, then go through your /etc/rc.d/rc.* files and
   get rid of any daemons you don't use, like crond, lpd, or selection.

   If you've got 4 MB and you're getting 'virtual memory exceeded in new'
   warnings, make sure you set up and activate a swap partition before running
   setup. If you're really hard up on memory, you can boot a rootdisk using
   'editroot' instead of one of the usual boot kernels. This will mount the 
   floppy in the root drive, and you'll have to install from the other drive
   or from the hard drive. You will also not be able to create any kind of boot
   disk, so you'll have to install LILO and take your chances. I only suggest
   using this approach if a swapfile will not work.

Q32: How do I make a bootdisk that uses a custom kernel?

A: Look in the ./kernels subdirectory. You'll find complete instructions
   on how to make them in there.

-----

Q33: When I installed Slackware, the system could see my CD-ROM just fine.  
     But, when I try to boot using LILO or the bootdisk the system doesn't 
     find the CD-ROM drive anymore!  How can I fix this?

A: The problem is probably that you used a bootdisk with support for your
   CD-ROM drive, but didn't install a kernel with support.  
 
   If you're ready to try compiling a kernel, you can easily solve this problem
   by compiling a custom kernel (see the section about compiling a Linux kernel)
   or, you can load the CD-ROM driver in the form of a kernel module.  You can
   do this by editing the /etc/rc.d/rc.modules file to load the module for your
   CD-ROM drive the next time you boot.  

   Here's the section of the file that loads CD-ROM drive modules:

 # These modules add CD-ROM drive support.  Most of these drivers will probe
 # for the I/O address and IRQ of the drive automatically if the parameters
 # to configure them are omitted. Typically the I/O address will be specified
 # in hexadecimal, e.g.: cm206=0x300,11
 #
 #/sbin/modprobe aztcd aztcd=<I/O address>
 #/sbin/modprobe cdu31a cdu31a_port=<I/O address> cdu31a_irq=<interrupt>
 #/sbin/modprobe cm206 cm206=<I/O address>,<IRQ>
 #/sbin/modprobe gscd gscd=<I/O address>
 #/sbin/modprobe mcd mcd=<I/O address>,<IRQ>
 #/sbin/modprobe mcdx mcdx=<I/O address>,<IRQ>
 #/sbin/modprobe optcd optcd=<I/O address>
 # Below, this last number is "1" for SoundBlaster Pro, or "0" for a clone.
 #/sbin/modprobe sbpcd sbpcd=<I/O address>,1
 #/sbin/modprobe sonycd535 sonycd535=<I/O address>
 #/sbin/modprobe sjcd sjcd=<I/O address>

   To use one of these, edit out the '#' in front of the line for your CD-ROM
   drive.  If you know the I/O address and/or IRQ for your board, fill it in on
   the line.  For example, you might change the sbpcd line to look like this if
   you've got a SoundBlaster CD-ROM at 0x300:

/sbin/modprobe sbpcd sbpcd=0x300,1

   If you need to access your CD-ROM drive so that you can get the modules
   package installed, use the same bootdisk you installed the system 
   with to get into your machine.  Use a command like this on the LILO prompt,
   but replace the root device name with the one you used on your machine:
 
   mount root=/dev/hda1

   Once you're logged in, install the modules package:

   installpkg /cdrom/slakware/a*/modules.tgz

Q34: Can I install using a console on a serial port?

A:   Yes, the bootdisks included with Slackware include support for putting
     the system console on a serial port.  To do this, you need to use
     console=ttyS0 or console=ttyS1 (these examples would be for COM1: and
     COM2:) as extra parameters on the bootdisk's boot prompt.

     For example, to install using a serial console, you would boot a bootdisk
     such as bare.i and wait for it to stop at the boot prompt.  Then enter
     this to boot the kernel using COM1 as the console:

       ramdisk console=ttyS0

     To install from a bootable CD-ROM using the serial console, enter the
     name of the kernel and serial port to use on the "boot:" prompt:

       bare.i console=ttyS0

----

Q35: What does "Bus error" mean?

A:   Usually it means your machine has run out of RAM.  See if you can set up
     some swap space or a swap file -- that should fix the problem.

----

In addition, the LDP people have put out an excellent set of manuals for Linux.
These are available on metalab.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP.
